The current version is 0.53 because 0.36 (the last "non-beta" release) + .16 (the number of "beta" releases since then) = 0.52. The Windows port is now called "MAME" (instead of "MAMEW"). The DOS port is called "DMAME".

-  1st April 2000: Guru - Dumped 1942 (Bootleg).

- 0.21: Fixed tempo speed in 1942. It was playing at half speed. Should be correct now. Also fixed a bug in noise volume of PSG. Noise was playing at half volume.

- 0.20: 1942 has correct colors. Also fixed rom paging, so now it has no more slowdowns. Fixed jerkiness. Sound is better, too.

- 0.20: Brad Oliver fixed 1942 background scroll.

- 0.19: Paul Leaman (author of the 1942 emulator) provided exhaustive information on (guess what) 1942, which is now supported.

TODO:

* NO GOOD DUMP KNOWN:  prom (Priority)


Bugs:

- There are priority errors with the playfields. It's most noticeable on the very last stage. You see the inside of the blimp, but can only see the catwalk after pressing 'F4' and viewing the tilemaps. It also seems to happen on a midway level, but it's not as obvious. Screenshots ending in "A" are in-game and "B" and "C" are shown by using F4: 1A 1B 1C 2A 2B 2C 3A 3B 3C. 64street057gre fart_flower

- There seems to be some background sound missing from level 3-1. The level is different from the rest because the player is on a flatbed train that speeds down the tracks. My guess is the arcade has background noise of a choo-choo train (or something) and no music. But in MAME there's nothing but sound effects. (As in: thwack, pow, bang, slap!). It seems totally wrong to be on a speeding train level and have complete silence in the background. I'm also wondering if it's normal for the sound effects to be panned hard right...? 64street057gre_2 fart_flower


WIP:

- 0.36b5: Correct 68000 CPU1 clock speed to 12MHz.

- 0.36b3: Alessio Manuele added clone 64th. Street - A Detective Story (Japan).

- 26th March 1999: Nicola fixed 64th Street to work with the C 68k core.

- 19th February 1999: Luca Elia has made a Jaleco Mega System 1 driver, but currently only P-47 (Jap) and 64th Street are supported.

0.33b4 [Aaron Giles]


Bugs:

- 720, 720b: This is an old bug. The arcade machine synchronized the spinning of the stick to the spinning of the character, and MAME can't do this. | I ran into a 720 a few weeks ago at a bar and had a close look (well as close as you can look in a bar). It had "grooves" that sort of "persuaded" your movement towards whichever of the 8 ways it was closest to, which helped you play, for instance going up most sidewalks was a perfect diagonal. Here are pics that may or may not be useful pic 1 pic 2 Since lots of mice/mice drivers vary in movement speed, having an alternate joystick configuration would be nice, like supporting 8-way digital joysticks to spin somewhat quickly in the direction you move. 720057yel TriggerFin / Smitdogg


WIP:

- 0.76u1: Aaron Giles added clones 720 Degrees (rev 1), (rev 2), (German, rev 1) and (German, rev 2).

0.36b2 [Manuel Abadia]


Bugs:

- In two player mode, there are some problems with the player sprites. This happens in the stage with the first person perspective, when you are driving some vehicle through a corridor. It seems to affect gameplay, too. aliens36b16gre Frotz

- aliens, probably all clones: There are a few graphics glitches. On an early stage when the player steps out of the water, a garbagey line appears where his foot is underwater (snapshot 1). On the last stage when you fight the final boss, pieces of the machine you can control flicker around the screen occasionally, and the boss' tail detaches from his body. (snapshot 2 snapshot 3 snapshot 4). Note: These glitches during the final boss are actually worse than they appear in these shots, they didn't pic up very well with the snaps. aliens059gre Smitdogg


Possible Bugs:

- Clone aliensj: In the test screen with the raster is just a black block with nothing in it. All other versions show the copyright there. aliensj079gre Firewave

0.37b3 [Aaron Giles, Paul Leaman]


Bugs:

- When entering initials and d.o.b. details, the cursor does not wrap around correctly and only wraps to about the centre (this may or may not be a bug) but when trying to enter date of birth you cannot select a year that ends in a 7. This bug exists back as far as mame053. The analog X-range is not set to the full range possible in MAME. However, if you add even one 'point' to the movement range, you can fix the name entry, but the gameplay cursor loops at the extremes of movement. Perhaps the value should be fractional, but I doubt MAME would like setting this. alleymas059gre Chook / El Condor


WIP:

- 29th November 2001: Aaron Giles fixed Alley Master / Power Play background graphics.

- 24th May 2000: Aaron Giles sent in a minor Leland update, fixing Alley Master crash and adding some clone romsets.

- 15th May 2000: Aaron Giles finally submitted the Leland driver first started by Paul Leaman, adding the following games: Cerberus, Mayhem 2002, World Series, Alley Master, Danger Zone, Baseball The Season II, Super Baseball Double Play Home Run Derby, Redline Racer, Quarterback, Strike Zone Baseball, Viper, John Elway's Team Quarterback, All American Football, Ironman Stewart's Super Off-Road, Ataxx, World Soccer Finals, Pigout and Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat.

- 11th June 1999: Paul Leaman and Nicola added one of the DACs to the Leland driver. There are still some sprite problems to be fixed until Alley Master is ready for a release.

- 31st May 1999: Paul Leaman added some Leland games to the driver and Alley Master is the first playable Leland game in the driver, but it still needs polishing before it can be released.

- 30th May 1999: Paul Leaman sent another Leland driver update, but none of the games are yet playable.

0.68 [Aaron Giles]


HardDisk required


Bugs:

- Clone a51mxr3k: When you go into test mode to adjust the volume, the game reports that the sound CPU is not responding, and the game gets stuck in a loop. When you try to reset, it gives the watch dog error. a51mxr3k071u2gre Reznor007

- Clone a51mxr3k: When doing the disk check, the throughput seems locked at 3999KB/sec...which is slow compared to the real thing. The real one goes around 6500KB/sec. a51mxr3k071u2gre2 Reznor007


WIP:

- 13th October 2003: Aaron Giles fixed the CPU speedup in Area 51 / Maximum Force Duo R3000 version, and fixed the timer problems for good (hopefully).

- 0.71u2: Added clone Area 51 / Maximum Force Duo (R3000).

-  9th July 2003: Brian A. Troha added the R3000 version of Area 51 / Maximum Force Duo.

NOTE:

WIP:

-  8th March 2004: R. Belmont - Dumped Sega's Star Wars Trilogy and Air Rescue. David Haywood - This looks pretty but the game seems to be protected and/or will require emulation of 2 system32 boards at once, not fun.

0.30 [Brad Oliver]


Bugs:

- arkanoid, arkatour: Music & Sounds in the sound test of the Service Mode plays at twice the speed/tempo of in the game. Update: PCB test: I figured it out, dip switch 6 puts you in test mode. On sound 0A I ran a stopwatch 4 times on the computer and got 3.3x seconds, on my machine 4 times I got 3.8x-3.9x seconds. So it's not twice as fast but it's noticably faster. Update: It seems a CPU clock speed problem. Setting it to about 4.5-4.8 Mhz fixes it. arkanoidc059gre ZeroKnightRaiden / dwidel / Kale

- When you press the tilt button the "tilt" text will show for a short while and then it says "bad hardware". Thanks to the (some parts unemulated) protection in Arkanoid, the "BAD HARDWARE" message appears, probably since the protection routines in the driver get confused with that kind of a reset. Assuming that the machine does get back to normal after the TILT mech goes off (like most games), this is indeed a bug. arkanoid061gre JonasPersson / The tECHIDNA


Possible Bugs:

- Clone arkatour: there is a black block in the title screen. Is it supposed to be there? If you hit the coin button for the first time you see it flash once and it is filled with same gfx as the rest of the screen. arkatour079gre Friewave


WIP:

Bugs:

- There are some sprites (bullets fired by big bosses), which have wrong colors. arkarea37b5gre Lord Caos

- On the game ending, there's a (strange) screen that says the hardware of the PCB. According to this, the sound CPU speed should be 5Mhz and not 4Mhz, and the palette color range should be 4096 / 16 = 256 (see snapshot). arkarea061ora Kale

Bugs:

- Subsequent bonus rounds (After rounds 5 and 9) are unplayable because of missing money bag sprite. Update (MAME .58) : This bug doesn't happen every time it's played. Update (MAME .65) : The bug isn't as severe now but the money bag and bonus score still get cut off on the side of the screen. You only see the last two zeros of the prize money. You can also see part of the player's hand is missing. It would appear that the money bag should be in the player's hand. Nevertheless, the bonus round is pretty playable now. armwrest35b9yel Sardius / BSR / Karasu

0.37b13 [Olivier Galibert]


Bugs:

- Working all over fine with the new added shadows, but look at the shots... zeros filling the ground... and in the ending on the right top. Update: There seems to be a layer bug at the end, see the pngs, the shield laying on the ground is moving and floating in the air when Asterix is moving, the same is for the zeros at the ground, they disappear when Asterix is walking upwards. And another thing I noticed is that the arena is fixed when Asterix is moving, which is not correct (afaik, I never made it that far in the arcade). Sometimes there is the picture of Nero at the top which is moving when Asterix walks, this should also be at a fixed place (on his throne). Another update from Kale: I had the original PCB and I know how it was like. The problem is the scrollx and scrolly not being hooked up for the background tilemap in this part of the game. In MAME the arena seems mono-screen, when it should be about three screens wide and another half of height (see snapshots). asterix053gre Iron Man / Taucher0815 / Kale

- When flipping the display some things get offset way to the left, like, half the screen. asterix_1055gre NeoGouki

- The scrolling on the top (the clouds) looks a bit strange... a line seems to hang or be to slow. checked that twice (the 3rd level). The sky issue found in the boat level can also be seen in the flying carpet level. It's not very visible on this screenshot, but the sky is divided into several "stripes" that all scroll at different speeds, making it look very strange. save state (from MAME .59, World ver, EAD) asterix_2055gre Iron Man / NeoGouki / DCisTHEbest

- During the ending sequence, there's a small, small bug in the top right of the screen, looks like it's linked to the color cycling fire somehow. save state (from MAME .59, World ver, EAD) asterix_3055gre NeoGouki / DCisTHEbest

NOTE:

- Once all top ten scores are first recorded, the first game played score that does NOT reach within the 1-10 range will cause the third initial of the 10th place score to be truncated. This bug will repeatedly occur whenever a higher score proceeds to bump down the lower placed scores and eventually the first game played score that does not reach the top ten, will cause the truncation of the third initial of the 10th place score. This is a bug in the game and not the emulation. Tested on a real machine. gregf

0.37b9 [David Graves, Brian A. Troha]


NOTE:

- When you fire, the sound it makes is like you've got a machine gun, but you're only firing 1 or 2 bullets per second. If you tap the fire button, you can get a much greater rate of fire; not sure if this is a bug or due to my machine's speed? I'm also assuming that your bullets aren't meant to go to the top of the screen, because they don't unless you move up near the top... (happens in Raine as well). Some people who checked the real arcade reported me that these issues (sounds like a machine gun and bullets don't go to the top of the screen) are original works. Fujix

0.31 [Zsolt Vasvari]


NOTE:

- There's no second button to rotate pieces clockwise. Many ports of Tetris (notably the Gameboy version) have two rotate buttons, but the Atari versions do not. Several people have reported that they've played the Atari version on machines that allowed you to rotate the pieces both clockwise and counter-clockwise. However, the currently supported ROM sets do not have inputs for a second button, so it is definitely not an error. While there is a chance that such a version might exist, nobody has been able to provide conclusive proof of it. Tron

0.36b2 [Mathis Rosenhauer, David Fish]


DIP/Input Bugs:

- Mouse controls both the AD Stick and the Dial - they're supposed to be used independently, for the ship's bearing and turret rotation, respectively. This renders the game unplayable. The best way would be to have the mouse mapped to the dial only, so that keys or an analog joystick can be mapped to the AD Stick. Update: The problem is a combo of mame's un-remappable mouse axis inputs and the one analog X axis & one analog Y axis per player. If input type is a dial, trackball, or AD stick, the mouse is automatically mapped to player one's mame X & Y axis. Dial uses mame's X axis (DialV Y axis), while the trackball & AD stick use mame's X and Y axis. So if you have any two for one player, you get a conflict as you found out. A quick hack would be to switch the AD stick to Player 2. Another hack, change the AD stick X axis type to the (as yet) unused AD stick Z axis, snuck in there with my "remap analog joysticks" fix. ;p Best solution, let the list of inputs handle the analog data much like digital inputs are, instead of a fixed array. (Or, a list of just the analog inputs would be great too.) Hmmm.... sensitivity, joy/key speed, etc will need to be worked around... Update: the AD stick X axis to Y axis part is fixed. aztarac064gra MarcoNadal / uRebelScum

0.60 [David Haywood]


NOTE:

- On the flyer it says that barricade has both user adjustable points per game, and speed. From experimenting it looks like points per game is the same dipswitch as hitme's chips, and speed is hitme's hands. The flyer says 1-7 points per games, but it really can go to 8.

- The Barricade rom is using a resolution of 32x24 which suggests slightly different hardware from HitMe (40x19) however the screenshot on the arcade flyer is using a 40x19 resolution. So is this a different version of Barricade or is the resolution set by a dip switch?


WIP:

- 0.80u1: Aaron Giles added Discrete_Components sound. It was patched in as a test and may be removed. It uses the Hit Me sounds for now. Until it can be confirmed against a schematic or real sound board.

0.36b2 [Aaron Giles]


NOTE:

- Batman has some problems with sprite priority. Pictures are from early levels, problems usually occur when Batman is jumping up over something (see sceenshots). Sadly, not a bug. The priority system for this game was primitive. I have the original PCB and can confirm that the priorities there suck just as bad. Aaron Giles


Bugs:

- There is still a graphical error to left of the screen during the movie. On these two pictures you can black lines on the left side. This happens when the attract mode plays (see snapshots). Also, from what was batman237b16gre, there are very small graphical glitches (lines) in attract mode (see the line by Batman's mouth, also the line to the left of the high score screen, and similar ones in the driving sequence (see the purple lines on the street. Update (MAME .61) :The attract mode is perfect now. There are no purple lines in the street in the driving sequence, but in that part there is a row of pixels in the left part which flashes in white and red. batman36b4gre Smeagol / DCisTHEbest / Pi

After shooting the tanks, the rubble-sprite of the tank will stay on screen. If you scroll left or right, the rubble will scroll too and it won't stay on the boss. If new tanks emerge, old tank rubble will disappear. If the boss is killed, tank rubble will not disappear but scroll with the screen (see snapshots). batsugun060gre Jonemaan

Update (MAME .67) : I got bored, and played and played and played through this, and found something. If you look at the layers during the endings, part of the dialogue is in tilemap0 and part is in tilemap1. Put together, they work fine (see snapshots) - (0 on the left, 1 on the right). Use a character from map 0, then map 1, map 0, repeat. Note that for some reason MAME32.67 currently puts these together properly AND displays them (though over the pictures as opposed to in the 'dialogue box'). batsugun057gre Jonemaan / big_lenny_c

0.37b2 [Bryan McPhail]


Bugs:

- When you are fighting agains the first final boss (the submarine), you can see it even if it is under the water. Maybe a sprite priority problem or maybe a shadow/highlight effect not implemented. See screen shot. Also, in this game, in the vertical scrolling levels, if you move down, you can see the top score table appearing suddenly in the down side of the screen. battlera37b2gre Lord Caos

- Sprites in the same plave where the black box with text that appears sometimes are printed in front of them. Is this how it should be? (sometimes is hard to read the text). Also, in the last level, when you are fighting agains the final boss (the big Chopper), you can see it even when it goes down behind the mountain. It seems to be the same problem as with the submarine in the first level). battlera37b3gre Lord Caos

- bldwolf, battlera: Down red arrows aren't drawn correctly. The top part is drawn on the bottom and the bottom part is drawn at the top (see snapshot). bldwolf061gre Kale

0.68 [?]


NOTE:

- 'BB' Prototype isn't a game as such, 'BB' was the label on the prototype board. which appears to have been used simply for testings / practice. There is no 'game' to it, no title screen, simply 3 characters, 1 portrait, 1 background, the characters don't appear to have any moves other than basic walking around. There is also no sound. The lack of Sound, GFX and Gameplay in this 'game' are NOT emulation bugs. There are some unused GFX in the roms, it might be interesting to try and put them together and see what they form.

0.37b8 [Mathis Rosenhauer]


TODO:

* Hook up sound (DAC/Custom + 6840 Timer)


NOTE:

- Beezer resets on level 9 if a laid egg is allowed to hatch. - beezer1 supports 10 bees at a time, levels 10 and up start with 10 bees and earlier levels can hatch new bees from eggs. However when there are 9 bees (not counting the queen) on any level a new egg will be removed instead of hatching. This is due to a bug in the rom which was fixed in beezer. When beezer is in the same situation as above it resets when the egg hatches creating the 10th bee. This is due to another bug in the rom that was exposed when the above beezer1 bug was fixed. beezer1 has wrong colours on levels 10, 20, 30 etc. This is due to a bug in the rom which was fixed in beezer. Of course I don't have a real machine to confirm but am pretty sure that the emulation has nothing to do with these problems. Since it's almost impossible to get past level 9 on beezer without it resetting I'm wondering if a later undumped version exists. insideoutboy


WIP:

- 0.37b8: Mathis Rosenhauer added Beezer (set 1) and clone (set 2).

- 27th September 2000: Mathis Rosenhauer cleaned up the Beezer driver a bit.

- 21st September 2000: Mathis Rosenhauer sent in a driver for Beezer.


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- Watch out for the bees. They will sting you.

- Trap bees in six sided cells by pushing gates.

- First build a trap with an open corner. Then wait for a bee to enter your trap.

- Push the gate closed to trap the bee inside. But be careful not to trap yourself.

- Earn BONUS points for each hive level won.

- Watch out when the queen bee comes out. She can break traps and will lay bee eggs.

- Eat eggs before they watch into new bees.

- Eggs energize you with powerr to eat bees. Be careful when the beezer stops flashing.

- Enter a cave to go across the hive.

NOTE:

- When you set the "Bonus Lives" dip switch to '60k 120k', the game says '80000 160000' instead of '60000 120000' in the service mode. Dip switches are correct. Note however, that when you set the "Bonus lives" Dip Switch to '60k 120k', it is written '80000 160000' in the test mode (this is an ingame bug, not a MAME bug !). In bermudaj, the bug in the test mode for "bonus life" was fixed : it is written "60000 120000". stephh

NOTE:

- Biofreaks was actually released as a console game at some point, but this is the original arcade version running on Seattle hardware. It's pretty much unfinished - there's no attract mode, and definitely some bugs in the camera movement, but most of the characters seem playable. Sadly, it's a pretty weak fighter, even in comparison to weak fighters like War Gods. -Aaron Giles 


WIP:

- 0.81u5: Aaron Giles mapped more inputs and DIP switches for Biofreaks. Added 'Boot ROM Test' and 'Hilink download??' dipswitches.

- 0.78: Added missing HD image and unknown dipswitches - Game now playable.

- 0.77u3: Aaron Giles fixed several minor bugs that affected Biofreaks and California Speed and increased default visible area to handle Biofreaks. Tweaked the Midway PIC handling so that Biofreaks can read its serial number. Correct audio ADSP2115 CPU2 clock speed to 16MHz and graphics resolution to 512x400.

-  7th December 2003: Aaron Giles fixed several minor bugs in the Seattle driver that affected Biofreaks and California Speed (but they're still not fully working).

Bugs:

- When playing on stage 2 'infiltration' (or just using the sound test) the music (Sound test 02)'s second loop has several of the instruments offset forward (in time) from when they should be playing. On subsequent loops it gets worse and worse. It sounds to me like something is looping over ['wrapping around'] too late/incorrectly. Same thing happens on the pcb. Fujix

TODO:

* Hook up sound (unknown sound CPU + 2x OKI6295 and YM2203 ?)


Possible Bugs:

- You don't have to kill the first boss. You get to (what I presume to be) the boss at the end of the first level normally. However, after only a short period of time (a few seconds, much less than the amount of time required to kill the second boss, say), the level just ends. It just sends you to the next level; the boss doesn't go through any death animation, nor do you get any points. This occurs in either one-player or two-player mode. bioship071u2gre DSOK

- 16th October 2003: R. Belmont sent in a driver for 'Bishi Bashi Champ Mini Game Senshuken', it's playable with sound but some graphics are wrong possibly due to a bad ROM.

-  6th July 2003: R. Belmont (WIP) put a few hours into a driver for 'Bishi Bashi Champ Mini Game Senshuken' (1996, Konami). It's basically a stripped down MW/GX-based mini-board with some rather unKonami-like features outside of the video hardware. Go figure. It passes the ram/rom test and runs now, but inputs, colors, and the tilemap decoding are all incorrect. Ongoing... (Update: Haze helped with the tile decoding, so I'll post some very early screens...).

DIP/Input Bugs:

- "Crow" DSW has no effect, crow is always on. Update:I tested this further and even went back to .71 MAME for testing too. It appears the crow object is currently not accessable with any switch settings. Besides disabling the crow, the flight pattern is not changed either when playing Birdie King. I am guessing the bug has always existed since Birdie King was first emulated in the bking2.c driver. Compare this with Birdie King 2. The crow can be disabled and the flight pattern can also be altered. I am guessing there are only two flight patterns even though there are 4 listings. 1 & 3 share same flight pattern while 2 & 4 share same crow flight pattern. New findings and comparisons: For Birdie King dips settings, "year display" works, "number of holes" works. Another dip that does not work in Birdie King dip settings besides "disabling Crow", is "free play". I tested with both .81 and also back to .71 for comparing. Anyway, part of the dips for Birdie King do work while other dip settings are "non-functional". bking077gra BarnacleEd / gregf

TODO:

* NO GOOD DUMP KNOWN:  a24_22


NOTE:

- MCU protection: MAME simulated the typical protection HW test and another protection routine with 0x30 command when the player have to shot on the green.


Bugs:

- On some cup-ins, any result besides "In the cup" (that's past bogey territory) and "Give up!" for a hole will make the game reset. This is due to incomplete MCU emulation / lack of MCU dump. bking3076u2red BarnacleEd / The tECHIDNA


WIP:

- 0.69: Angelo Salese fixed a few MCU simulation problems in bking3.

- 17th May 2003: Angelo Salese fixed a bug in the MCU simulation of Birdie King 3.

-  9th May 2003: Angelo Salese simulated the MCU in Birdie King 3 so it is fully working now.

- 16th March 2003: Pierpaolo Prazzoli and Tomasz Slanina added Birdie King 3 to the Birdie King 2 driver but it suffers from unemulated protection.

Possible Bugs:

- If the screen fades, and the game does that many times, colors will be wrong for a second. Tried with 16bit depth and 8bit depth. blandia137b5gre Jonemaan

- In Irriana stage, background is a scrolling landscape. The landscape gfx is too short or cut out and you sometimes see a blue background instead. In Jurane stage, the whole bottom of the screen is filled with solid gray. It masks both background and main sprites. There's also a priority problem between layer with pillars and status text/energy bars in this level. blandiap057gre_1 Nomax

STORY:

- It was long long ago, an unimaginable time past. Shortly after people discovered copper, there were continuous battles over gold in various regions. Man of power who were supposed to protect the people and promote the prosperity of the town battled cach other for gold, and all the people where ensnared in war. Amidst the fury, a man calling himself "King" appeared among them. He commanded the authorities to turn over all gold to him. Naturally, those in power refused. And all the towns opposing the King were destroyed by the King's magic. Some people engaged the King in man-to-man combat to save their towns. But all challengers perished in a sea of blood before this swordsman king, who claimed to be the strongest man alive. People feared him, calling him "The Man Gold King". All the gods pay head to these earthly events and selected six strong man, one each from six towns in possession of a holy shrine. The gods decided to choose one of the six with whom they would endow the power to vanquish the Mad Gold King. From now on, it is up to you to create the story.

Bugs:

- I have never saw the game in real but obviously there are some problem with the demo in the attract mode : the panther hit the first 2 enemies, but miss the following 2. But it think it killed them and act like if they were no more (and then die immediatly, by those 2 unkilled enemies). It's like the game speed is out of sync with the recorded demo player move. blkpnthr37b11gre YMI

Bugs:

- When finishing game on the fourth course (you must select it just after pressing start on the begining of a game), after 2 ending screen, you got a cell testing screen instead of the programmer team credit (you must reset the game to get out of there). blocken137b8gre YMI

- It needs some kind of zooming sprite effect for some on-screen messages and for the compressed loser face. blocken237b8gre YMI

- Some of the enemy voice are totally wrong (like the purple bird having a girls voice, or the ship-robot saying "I'm the champion" when losing, etc...). blocken337b8gre YMI

- In Attract Mode, on the demonstration play (one versus another), after about every second the screen freezes for a while (about 5-10 frames), then continues normally then goes another freeze and continues and so on, until the demonstration leaves. Other attract mode "items" are unaffected by this. FPS counter stays a solid 60/60. blocken059gre_1 Kale

- Regardless of the course chosen, in the first intermission there's no road on the map. This happens on every play (not only the first). In the second and successive intermissions the road is present. blocken059gre_2 Kale

Possible Bugs:

- (1) Start a new game, but don't enter any of the warps. It helps to transform to Speeder so you can stay in the middle of the screen with minimal effort. (2) Let yourself run out of energy. You'll get text warnings about low energy, and then your ship blows up and you're taken to the continue screen. Notice that the background changes and the message reads "Continue at same level?" The background will display with odd colors. (3) Continue the game. You'll start at level 1, whose background displays with a bad color set. (See a screenshot here.) The level plays just fine, and is at Novice difficulty (any items you pick up during this game will show their initial information messages). (4) As you play, notice the number of sectors you have to clear when you exit a sector. It'll be a total of 16 sectors, but you will only be able to select from the first 9! When those 9 are done, you're stuck - you won't be able to make any more progress in the game. Also, the background music for each sector after the first one is some sort of rock-style music, which I haven't heard elsewhere in the game and I haven't had the patience to find out if it's the same as in the harder levels. Played around with it a little more and discovered that if you warp into Medium, Hard or Expert levels at the start of the game, defeat the first galaxy and the first round with Mukor, and THEN let yourself run out of energy on the next warp screen: The game puts you back into the last level of the galaxy you just conquered (when you continue), tells you to warp to fight Mukor, and then lets you fight him again! And I think it's a different configuration of "ports" on Mukor's body this time. When you've defeated him for the second time, you end up at the warp screen again, and running out of energy and continuing will only put you on the warp screen again and again. (In other words, you can't fight Mukor infinite times this way.) Also, the "rock music" I referred to earlier is indeed from the 4th warp in Hard and Expert levels. blstroid060gre Dorsola

Bugs:

- When the final boss dies, he looks like a pink brain with a face. If you watch closely, you'll see that this sprite slightly glitched; there's a thin black line crossing its face. blswhstl36b16gre Frotz


DIP/Input Bugs:

- Minor input bug. Pressing a key mapped to either button will fire both cannon and bombs (i.e. pressing ctrl or Joy1 Button 1 alone will fire both, and alt or joy2 button 2 likewise) despite both buttons being mapped to completely different keys or buttons on the input menu. It only seems to happen on blswhstl, not on detatwin. blswhstl056gra Jpikachu

WIP:

- 29th March 2004: Charles MacDonald - Recently figured out how to get around the MCU protection in Body Slam, so I can run my own software. By forcing an address error in the initialization routine, I can get my exception handler to run before the MCU checksums the code, and it seems to resume control afterwards instead of leaving the 68000 halted.

0.37b16 [Yochizo, Stefan Jokisch]


NOTE:

- bonzeadv, bonzeadu and jigkmgri: The Bonus Lives dipswitches are wrong. The "Bonus lives" Dip Switches don't match the extra lives you can earn in the game (even if the display on the main screen is correct !), so this is in fact an ingame bug. MAME has the dipswitch info "incorrect" since it goes by what the game displays. Here are the bonus lives you can earn depending on the Dip Switches (with "easy" or "medium" difficulty): - when set to... you get your 2 first bonus lives at..."40K 100K", 40K & 200K -- "50K 150K", 50K & 200K -- "60K 200K", 60K & 250K -- "80K 250K", 80K & 250K. FYI, the "and mystery" is always the same : you get extra lives at 500K, 1M, 2M, 3M, 4M, 5M, 6M and 7M. Here's some more technical info proving this.- stephh

- bonzeadv, bonzeadu and jigkmgri: There's no music at level 4 (Bloody Pond). There should be no music, just that scary background noises (select sound code 56 in service mode, it's called "theme round 4").-frotz

NOTE:

- The IC test routine takes over 20 seconds.


Bugs:

- If you let either an old or new version of Bosconian run through the attract mode, you will see the title scroll onto the screen over a gray background. Then that background will get wiped away to reveal the starfield beneath. But in 0.80 a vertical portion on the left side of that gray remains after the initial wipe and only gets erased as other objects come on screen. I believe the entire gray area is supposed to be wiped away all at once. The attached screenshot should show an example of some of the gray area remaining on the left side (see snapshot). bosco080u1gre Prophet


Possible Bugs:

- After I got four million points, the high score counter was not getting updated. The regular score counter kept going fine, but the high score never got updated again after the 3.999million and some points (see inp file and snapshots). bosco059gre SiKrAiKeN


WIP:

- 0.79u1: Nicola Salmoria correct tile/sprite priority handling in Bosconian and made a better emulation of the 50XX custom chip (no more need for hacks). Bosconian now uses a different sound PROM, which seems more correct. Correct the clock speed of the 3x Z80 CPUs to 3072000 Hz and replace Custom sound with Namco_52XX (1536000 Hz) and Namco_54XX (1536000 Hz).

- 0.37b12: Correct monitor/video frequency to 60.606060Hz.

- 0.37b2: Added clone Bosconian (older version).

- 0.36RC2: Added Bosconian (new version) romset.

- 0.36b11: Vernon C. Brooks fixed Bosconian score handling.

- 0.36b4: Gamester fixed scores in Bosconian.

- 0.36b1: Nicola Salmoria fixed controls and graphics in Commando (Sega), which is now fully playable. This also fixes diagonal shots in Bosconian. Jungler shots are broken though.

- 10th July 1999: Nicola made a major improvement to Bosconian, Commando (Sega), Rally-X and the rest, adding a missing character PROM.

- 0.35b5: Zsolt Vasvari added clone Bosconian (Midway, new version). Added sound1 prom.

- 26th February 1999: Zsolt Vasvari has added several clones (for Smash TV, Galaxian, Rampage, Satan's Hollow, Bosconian).

- 0.30: Martin Scragg added the background star field to Bosconian. Martin Scragg fixed Bosconian crashing: This was the speech processor being used for a protection check.

- 0.29: Toninho added the original, Namco version of Bosconian.

- 0.27: Martin Scragg added Bosconian support. [The sounds are from the M-ulator V 0.14 by Martin Scragg]

0.79u2 [David Haywood]


< France >


Bugs:

- When you eat a leaf, you hear a scratchy sound. It's supposed to be like a "ping" with different random tones each time. Sometimes after a reset, the first game you start might randomly produce the correct sound once or twice, then you get the scratchy sound. botanic080u1gre Pi


Possible Bugs:

- The dipswitches are wrong. For example, you can set the dsw for 2, 3, 4 or 5 lives. But the game only accpets two choices, for 3 lives (when 2 or 4 is selected) and for 5 lives (when 3 or 5 is selected). Thus, I guess there's only 1 bit in the dsw to define how many lives per game... The coin dsw doesn't work, it's always stuck in the "2c/1c 1c/1c 1c/3c 1c/7c" setting. For example in slot 1 it always needs 2 coins to get 1 credit, and slot 4 to you get 7 credits per coin, even when the default dsw setting is 1c/1c for slot 1 and 1c/14c for slot 4. The language dsw doesn't work, the text is always in French. The text is in rom bota_09.9m and it's only in French, along with some traces (apparently incomplete) of text in Spanish. The free play dsw doesn't work. Being in the bagman.c driver, I looked at bagman's dsw and they are similar. so maybe Valadon Automation changed the original game to run it on bagman hardware, but didn't adapt the software for all the dipswitches. So the dips are there but the game simply doesn't use them, or uses them in another way. So this may not be a bug, who knows. botanic080u1gra Pi

Bugs:

- I played one of these recently (no samples alas), but comparing the volume of the actual cab to this one, I'd say the proportions are off. In order to sound remotely like the real thing, the YM chip FM channel must be set to 100%, and the other YM channels all the way down to 5 (the FM is the main music, the other channels are the percussion). Even then, everything is far too quiet. bowlrama081u7ora El Condor

WIP:

- 0.35RC2: Nicola Salmoria incresed the horizontal resolution for NeoGeo to 320. This looks strange with some games, but it is definitely the correct value as I verified it on the real thing. Games like Puzzle Bobble and Baseball Stars use the extra area, while most of the other games draw just two bars in there. If a game looks odd, adjust your monitor to send the extra area offscreen.

0.11 [Mirko Buffoni]


NOTE:

- The indicator that shows how many chefs you have remaining is broken, so keep a careful count for yourself. This is probably due to a bug in the original Burger Time ROMs.


WIP:

- 18th August 2001: Zsolt Vasvari updated the 6502 CPU core so that another hack could be removed from the Burger Time decryption.

- 31st January 2001: Juergen Buchmueller further fixed the i8x41 core and hooked some parts of the DECO cassette system to the Burger Time driver.

-  8th July 1999: Zsolt Vasvari fixed Burger Time sprite placement in cocktail mode.

- 0.35: Burger Time (Data East set 1) is original and Burger Time (Midway) is clone now.

-  5th March 1999: Aaron Giles has fixed more drivers to work with rotation handling (galaga, frogger, burger time and their clones).

- 0.35b1: Nicola Salmoria added clone Burger Time (Data East set 1).

- 0.34RC1: Nicola Salmoria changed name of clone Hamburger to Cook Race.

- 0.33b3: Zsolt Vasvari did proper emulation of the ROM decryption in Burger Time.

- 0.29: Nicola Salmoria fixed Burger Time: Lives left are correctly displayed, sprites are turned off appropriately, and the switch test in test mode works correctly. The hardware of this game is more similar to Eggs than Nicola thought.

- 0.23: Some fix to Popeye and Burgertime sound pitch.

- 0.16: Various fixes to Burger Time: Fixed CPU clock speed to avoid slowdowns on fourth level. It's much faster on a 486. Sprites no longer "stick" on the screen on a level change. Fixed a bug in high score save. Fixed a couple of bugs in M6502 BCD arithmetic. One of them was causing the pepper counter in Burger Time to behave strangely.

- 0.13: Fixed all of the problems in Burger Time related to ROM encryption. Slices fall more than one level when an enemy is on them, no more crashes when a bonus life is earned, the high screen table works, two players mode works, and other things. Support for an alternate ROM set for Burger Time, which is likely an earlier version.

- 0.12: Sound support in Burger Time. This is the first multiple CPU game supported by MAME (two 6502, one for code, one for sound). It's not perfect, but we're getting there. Fixed speed in Burger Time (was running at about half the real speed). A similar change to the 6502 engine, it was needed by Burger Time which wouldn't accept coins otherwise.

- 0.11: Burger Time (Midway) and Donkey Kong 3 drivers provided by Mirko Buffoni. The colors for Burger Time should be accurate.

Bugs:

- On the level where you propel downward in a cave, near the end of the level there is a thick black line where gfx cut out (see snapshot). btoads074gre Smitdogg


Possible Bugs:

- The first thing I noticed was that during the snow level (level 2 I believe) when scrolling up/down, the topmost 5 pixels or so appear out of sync in some manner. Also, in the intermission before levels, the tv static "noise" is clipped slightly before the right edge, making the background gfx show through. Additionally, on the 2nd level intro, the tv static noise is moved also vertically. btoads057gre NeoGouki / Pi


WIP:

- 17th January 2003: Aaron Giles abstracted the TLC34076 palette chip emulation used by Art & Magic, Battletoads and a few other drivers.

-  3rd January 2003: Aaron Giles sent in another update that gets the 34010-based games working again after yesterday's changes, and he fixed BattleToads and Hard Drivin' to compute the VBLANK duration appropriately.

- 0.57: Aaron Giles made the BSMT2000 sound emulator.

- 28th November 2001: Aaron Giles sent in a driver for Battletoads.

STORY:

- This island is called "Rainbow island". Here there is a tower used to monitor the island and protect everyone who lives there from harm. In that tower there live two inseparable brothers. The older brother, a slight and cheerful lad, is named Bubby. And the younger brother, named Bobby, is a shy and quiet boy who likes to read. Then one day something suddenly happens to disturb their peaceful and happy lives. That something was their being turned into dragons at the hands of a mysterious evil being. The same evil being that did this to them has also destroyed the magical Rainbow Potion elixir they need to return to human form. The evil being, however, has sealed himself into the tower. Why is it that Bubby & Bobby were transformed into the shape of dragons? And what was the true intent of the evil being that did this to them?

0.27 [Chris Moore]


NOTE:

- The sequel to Bubble Bobble is Rainbow Island.

- Clone boblbobl: When you take the clock, the time doesn't freeze. This is not a bug. I used to own the original pcb of Bobble Bobble (Bootleg) and the clock never freezed the enemy. All it did was change the stage colors to the clock freeze. So this version is accurate. comboace


Bugs:

- The Clock bonus is supposed to stop time for a short period but stops the time forever. On some occasions, you could not reach some of the enemy to kill them, making you unable to finish the stage, and so you need to reset the game. Even the skel (white 'hurry up' monster) doesn't appear. bublbobl36b3yel YMI

- Looks perfect, but behaviour of enemies is quite different from real board, especially at stages where wizards appear. This appears at most stages, follows are explanations of remarkable comparison between MAME and real board with the inp file. More detail. bublbobl36rc2yel Fujix

- I have some (possibly new?) information about the bubble bobble driver and monster behaviour. See the attached disassembly of the 68705 ROM, the part labelled "Vreemd", address 0x1e3 to 0x336. It is responsible for calculating the differences in coordinates between 1) the player and 2) the monster in question. It does this by reading the main Z80 ram, calculating the differences (and flagging the sign of the difference), and finally writing these result factors back (see Orange.htm for more). bublbobl061ora Wladimir


Possible Bugs:

- I have finished the game Bubble Bobble, and I have a doubt about the end message text. This text scrolls up and when the text reaches the scores it becomes really hard to read it. I was wondering if this is who the coin-op works. Should the scores disappear before the end text scrolls? Or should the scrolling text disappear before reaching the scores? bublbobr36rc2gre Lord Caos

Bugs:

- In Burning Force, a pow-up bonus is carried from the left side of the screen sometimes and it is one of L, W, CL, M or H. In MAME, the random function of this doesn't work well and always gives a "L". It's probably related to the Namco protection chip, on some games they use them as random number generators (see snapshot from cab). burnforc079yel DK / Haze

0.77 [Aaron Giles]


HardDisk required


WIP:

- 0.82u2: Aaron Giles formalized support for the "widget" board used in vaportrx & calspeed, added more extensive documentation on the various boardsets, constants for the GT64010 and all interrupts and ethernet device interrupt support. Made the IDE controller visible on the PCI bus, hooked up CMOS protection bit, corrected sfrushrk audio CRCs and hooked up hard disk and marked sfrush and vaportrx as working.

- 0.78: Aaron Giles fixed remaining issues in California Speed, verified California Speed HDD dump (works in self test, not in boot ROM test) and change year to 1998 - Game now playable.

- 0.77u3: Aaron Giles fixed several minor bugs that affected Biofreaks and California Speed and fixed input ports for California Speed and SF Rush. Correct graphics resolution to 512x400 and add 'Boot ROM Test' dipswitch.

-  7th December 2003: Aaron Giles fixed several minor bugs in the Seattle driver that affected Biofreaks and California Speed (but they're still not fully working).

-  2nd December 2003: Aaron Giles - Well, I finally decided to figure out what the heck was up with California Speed. Turns out there were a few subtle problems in the PCI configuration code when setting up the 3dfx card. With that fixed, I was able to map the proper self-test button, and finally hook up all the controls. Then came some ugly sound synchronization issues. Like Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, this game won't boot unless the sound is working. After some fiddling, I was able to get it to work. Unlike San Francisco Rush, this one starts up and is playable, though there are some obvious color issues (well, not so obvious here, but it is in other screen shots). However, it doesn't last too long until we hit a snag. Much like San Francisco Rush, we get some math errors and the game freaks out. I really hope this doesn't mean I have to add full floating point exception support....

- 0.77u2: Added cpu2 sound rom (32k) and correct R5000 CPU1 clock speed to 150 MHz.

-  5th November 2003: Aaron Giles sent in the Atari Seattle driver, supporting CarnEvil, Blitz 99, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, Mace: The Dark Age (all working fine) and San Francisco Rush (freezes when starting a game).

- 27th May 2003: Aaron Giles updated the IDE controller emulation to support a couple more commands and added DMA bus mastering support that will be necessary for the Seattle games.

0.58 [Bryan McPhail]


TEST MODE:

- Reset with both start buttons held down for test mode.


Possible Bugs:

- In attract mode, the small pictures of the heroes appear before they should (or perhaps wrong priority here? I can't remember how the arcade version worked on this). captaven058gre_6 Karasu

-  In the ending, it starts to show the main 4 avengers in the game, and then the minor avengers that make cameos. You hear the announcments of the names of the 4 main ones, but they are said way after the pics are already gone (I think one said "Hawkeye" as it pictures Namor!). The voices are out of sync (or same damn lazzzzzzzy programming). captaven058gre_8 Karasu


WIP:

- 0.67: Added clones Captain America and The Avengers (US Rev 1.6) and (Asia Rev 1.0). Correct ARM CPU1 clock speed to 9333333 Hz. Change description from 'Captain America' to 'Captain America and The Avengers'

- 0.59: Added clone Captain America and The Avengers (Japan Rev 2). Rename (captav19) to (captavnu) and (captavee) to (captavne).

- 14th March 2002: chack'n added the Japanese version of Captain America, a World version of Gradius 3 and fixed quite a few ROM file names.

- 0.58: Added Captain America and The Avengers (Asia Rev 4) and clones Captain America and The Avengers (US Rev 1.9) and (UK Rev 4).

-  3rd February 2002: Bryan McPhail submitted the Captain America driver and ARM CPU core written by him and Phil Stroffolino. Captain America is almost perfect and includes sound, but the other games in that driver don't work - Fighter's History uses a protection chip, Dragon Gun and Locked 'N Loaded use a different sprite RAM format which is not yet emulated, and Tattoo Assassins works with sound, but lacks the graphics ROMs.

- 30th January 2002: Guru - Received a Captain America PCB to do a redump of a few ROMs two weeks ago. Thanks to Pelle for loaning me the board and Bryan McPhail for the emulation preview shots.

TODO:

* Accurate colors


NOTE:

- The IC test routine is very slow.


Bugs:

- When 2 cars run on the ramp in level 1 or level 3, rarely, the jumping sound will be played in 1 channel instead of 2. The sound will then pitch to a real high note. From this point on 2 things have happened to me: 1. The pitch went down again and jumpsound stopped, 2. The pitch stayed really high and played continuously after the cars had landed, sound went away when the ramp was used again. Note: This bug only happens occasionally. carjmbre057gre Jonemaan

Bugs:

- The game freezes up as soon as the opening screen comes up. Update: Since u7, it will start fine, but in the Rickety Town level, MAME exits a short time after you get and fire the acid weapon (about 1/2 way through lvl). I tried it twice, using 2 different acid powerups in that level, and MAME crashed both times. carnevil081red iceman2004cny / Reznor007

- After having played through a few levels, I noticed that the hit percentage always shows 0.0% Hits and shots are registered properly, but it seems to skip calculating the percentage. carnevil077gre Reznor007


WIP:

-  5th November 2003: Aaron Giles sent in the Atari Seattle driver, supporting CarnEvil, Blitz 99, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, Mace: The Dark Age (all working fine) and San Francisco Rush (freezes when starting a game).

- 0.35b1: Nicola Salmoria added clone Carnival (cocktail).

- 0.33b7: Peter Clare emulated music in Carnival, and support for a new set of samples. Added I8039 CPU2 and AY-8910 sound.

- 0.33b4: Marco Cassili did lots of clean up, consolidation, dip switches additions, color fixes to the Carnival driver (which is now called vicdual.c, since Carnival is just one of the many games which run on that hardware).

- 0.27: Mike Coates added partial sound support (through samples) to the Carnival driver. Thanks to Virtu-Al and Peter Clare, Carnival now has 100% accurate colors.

- 0.16: Thanks to Mike Coates and Peter Clare, Carnival now has colors.

- 0.15: Carnival is finally working! Many thanks to Richard Davies who understood how to make it accept coins.

- 0.12: Mike Coates pointed out that Carnival uses a RAM for character generation (like Nibbler) and provided a driver for it. It's still not playable, but the graphics are now correct.

- 0.08: Added some support for Carnival - it boots and runs the demo, but the graphics are messed up.

0.36b2 [Bryan McPhail]


NOTE:

- At the title screen the "Crude Buster", text turns up and displays correctly. Then just before the "insert coin" shows, two lines cross the text and when they've left the screen, the graphics are cut up in three segments, each shifted 4 pixels to the right of the one above. That behaviour is correct. I've got 4 of these pcbs (don't ask). Mish

This organization is called Big Valley, and their soldiers are armed with the most advanced and bizarre weapons. AND NOW ...The government has requested two men enter the ruins secretly and defeat Big Valley. These two men will be paid well for the job. These warriors names are...Crude Buster.

0.59 [Chris Hardy]

0.26 [Patrick Lawrence]


NOTE:

- To start a game, press the '5' and JUMP button. '1' and '2' work only in cocktail mode.

- Start buttons don't work unless the game is in cocktail mode. On the upright version of Crystal Castles, there are no dedicated start buttons. The left and right jump buttons double as 1-player and 2-player game start buttons. Note: previous versions of MAME mapped the "1" and "2" keys to the two jump buttons, so it didn't matter which you pressed. This has since been corrected to match the behaviour of the original machines.


WIP:

- 0.59: Added Crystal Castles (version 4) and the old version is now clone (version 3).

-  6th February 2002: Chris Hardy added a newer revision ROM set to the Crystal Castles driver.

- 0.28: Nicola Salmoria made accurate colors in Crystal Castles and load/save of high score and service menu settings.

Patrick Lawrence did a great work adding trackball support to the main core system. Trackball is enable with -trak parameter. Trackball support has been added to Centipede and Reactor. Also, Patrick provided a driver for Crystal Castles. Great Work! ;)

SERVICE MODE:

- Press F2 to enter service mode.


Possible Bugs:

- Some of the "text art" (for example, billboards, road signs, and any other misc. text that's not in the foreground) is inverted. "One Way" signs and non TV trucks are like this, and bus advertisments might be the same way. Most of it is fine, though...so it could just be a game bug. cischeat236b11gre Sports Dude

- When your car flips over and crashes, the speed is set to zero, like it should. However, when your car is still flipping, your car can still accelerate, and when it's turned back on the wheels, the car moves on normally, like it hadn't crashed. (Basically, you can get a "rolling start" after a crash.) cischeat336b11gre Sports Dude

NOTE:

- When reaching 900.000 points the game "awards" you with infinite lives. This is a bug in the game's code. Bugfinder


Bugs:

- I have noticed that one of the frames of the car jumping/changing directions seems to be out of order. It happens very seldom, and only when doing a certain tricky manoever (sp?) where you're simulatenously jumping and changing directions. The order of images in this sequence does seem odd, and there's one image (3 frames long) where the car first turns around, the image flips nose to tail but the pieces are not flipped to match. citycon37b13gre The Dog / TriggerFin

0.35b12 [Manuel Abadia, Phil Stroffolino]


Possible Bugs:

- Clone combascb: Crashes on level 3 and experiences various graphics glitches: on the 'game over' screen after playing a game, on level 3 before the game crashes, and at various places in attract mode after watching for a few cycles. On level 3 the screen became covered with "A"s, and I was repeatedly told to fire some weapon I didn't have. The screen cleared up, I played level 4, wrapped the counter around the fourth row of hits several times, then unthrottled it and watched the level not end (see snapshots). Snapshots from MAME .61: 1st snap is the intro garbage (some, there are more). 2nd snap is when things start to go wrong on level 3, strange enough for me aren't A's, they are N's. But for me the screen didn't clear up and rolled for next problems. In my case the game showed what's on 3rd snap and stopped. I'd have to rerun it but I think not even reset worked, had to get out of the game. combascb36finalyel Jeff B / TriggerFin / Pi

0.22 [Nicola Salmoria]


TEST MODE:

- Press P1 Button 1 during the startup message to enter the test screen.


WIP:

- 0.71: Added clone Space Invasion (Europe). Rename clone (spaceinv) to (sinvasnb).

-  4th July 2003: Brian A. Troha added the original European version of Space Invasion.

- 17th September 2002: Brian A. Troha added an original version of Space Invasion to the Commando driver.

- 23rd August 2000: Zsolt Vasvari converted 1942, Commando and Vulgus to the tilemap system.

- 0.36RC2: Added proms ($300 - palette selector (not used), $400 - interrupt timing (not used) and $500 - video timing (not used)).

- 0.35b12: Nicola Salmoria added clone Space Invasion.

- 0.34b2: Nicola Salmoria fixed Commando sometimes not starting. It was a bug in the decode routine, which has been completely rewritten.

- 0.31: Aaron Giles added new vblank_duration field in MachineDriver, which controls how long to delay screen refresh after a vblank interrupt. This is important to get video properly in sync in some games (e.g. sprites and background in Commando).

- 0.26: Fixed Commando dip switch bonus settings.

- 0.25: Nicola fixed Commando driver, so now intermissions have the correct tiles positioned.

- 0.23: "And there was MUSIC!". Thanks to Ishmair's FM engine, music is supported in Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Diamonds. Since the synthesis is based on FM generation via OPL, you must have a SoundBlaster, Adlib, or compatible to get the music. However Mirko Buffoni heavily dislike this approach and he is looking for documentation on FM generation.

- 0.22: Nicola added Commando. High score supported as well. Original Sound is done by YM2203 (FM synthesis) while now is done by 8910 (no FM). So music is not present.

0.33b7 [Carlos A. Lozano, Jose Tejada Gomez, Phil Stroffolino, Eric Hustvedt]


TEST MODE:

- Press 1P and 2P together to advance through tests.


NOTE:

- It seems the second player cannot continue until the first player needs to continue also. So basically the second player has to spend most his time just waiting for the first player to lose all his lives. I took a field trip this weekend to the Family Funspot in New Hampshire, and my buddy had to spend most of his time waiting for me to die before he could continue. It's just how the game worked... I think in those days they hadn't yet figured out how continuing should work. The NES version did a similar thing - when one player was out of lives, he could suck lives from the other player until both players were dead and then they could continue. jerryjanis


Bugs:

- contra and clones: I have seen that in Contra when the continue number appears, sometimes (usually the second continue) when you insert a coin and continue the game, part of the counter sprites stay in the screen. Update: This bug occurs when you continue with the timer on 10, or if you let the time run out - insideoutboy

- Clone gryzor: In cocktail mode, when it's 2p's turn, the gfx are messed up, the scores area doesn't flip and thus some gfx are placed totally wrong. gryzor065gre Smitdogg


Possible Bugs:

- contrab: When you finish this clone, instead of the credits, the screen becomes all black and the game hangs. Only happens in clone contrab (see inp file). contrab061yel Kale


WIP:

- 0.36b12: Patch all 64k gfx1 and gfx2 roms to 256k roms in all sets.

- 0.36b9: Added clone Contra (Japan).

0.53 [David Graves]


TODO:

* Accurate video emulation


NOTE:

- Continental Circus is a F1 racing game, featured dinamic weather and pitstops. This is probably the first arcade driving game to possess these features. It is believed that the word "circus" resulted from a bad translation from japanese to english, and this game name should actually be "Continental Circuit". However all the following home conversions would also be named "Continental Circus".


WIP:

- 0.82: Added clone Continental Circus (US set 2).

- 0.57: Correct graphics resolution to 320x224.

-  4th September 2001: David Graves improved the road colors in Continental Circus.

- 0.53: Added Continental Circus (World) and clone Continental Circus (US).

0.36b2 [Manuel Abadia]


Bugs:

- crimfght and clones: The music isn't playing at the correct speed. This (linked mp3) is ripped straight from my board, notice how the music stops immediately before the high score table appears, then play it on MAME, because the music isn't playing at the correct speed the music runs into the highscore table. It may not sound like it is out of sync much but it is much more noticable during play. Also I've noticed that some of the instruments in the music are really quiet, could be my sound card but I dunno (hear mp3). crimfght061gre ENAY

NOTE:

- Pac-Man (Midway), Ms Pac Man (bootleg), Crush Roller, Pengo and Lady Bug are the first supported games in MAME.


Bugs:

- In Magic Brush, you can never complete level 1. You can paint the entire playfield and it doesn't advance you to stage 2. This is a bootleg game but it used to be possible to pass stage 1 in earlier versions of MAME (see Marp) so it's an emulation bug I guess. mbrush067gre fuzzywzhe / Rattydog / Smitdogg

Possible Bugs:

- When playing tennis on Capcom Sports Club (Euro 970722), there's an extra challenger stage if you win against all 3 players without losing, but the game crashes at that point and the screen turns black with a bunch of numbers. It also happens on the Asia set if you region change it to Europe (and the Euro set works when set to Asia).. Either the 68k core is too sensitive to bad code or its a game bug imo. csclub072u1yel unit3uk / Haze

< Japan >


Bugs:

- There are many things in Cuby Bop that make the game seem like it's a prototype (and it's probably by Hot-B instead of Taito). Some interesting things I found while playing Cuby Bop: 1) Press 1 player start while in the game to skip stages. 2) I looked in the graphics roms (press F4) and found that there is sort the logo (and a sort of a copyright notice) for Hot-B (which may explain why the music and sound FX are taken directly from Playgirls 2, another Hot-B game). It doesn't display on the screen, and I don't see any references to Taito, either. 3) At the end of the game (which seems to be after Stage 16), the game displays this: "Thank you for playing up to this game. You are a very good player, aren't you? Because this game is now under location test, we are very sorry not to show you the next stage of the game. We are terribly sorry for this and hope to see you again, sometime and someplace." cubybop37b14ora The tECHIDNA

0.36b4 [Ernesto Corvi, Tatsuyuki Satoh]


Bugs:

- In 2 player games, screen area for 2nd player is inverted. Update from stephh: The following apply at least to NAMCO games based on namcos1 driver, but they might work for some other NAMCO games (this needs to be tested) ... When you enter the test mode, you'll notice a "type" Switch which can be either 'A', 'B', or 'C' ... As there is almost no explabation about what each type does, here they are : A = Cocktail (each player has it owns controls, and the game is flipped for player 2) B = Upright 2 players (each player has it owns controls, but the game is NOT flipped for player 2) C = Upright 1 player (same controls for BOTH players, and the game is NOT flipped for player 2) If you look carefully at 'dangseed' you can see the following info that confirm the previous one:  A (TABLE), B (VS UP.) and C (UPRIGHT). Also note that the DEFAULT settings might vary from one version to another : for example, 'pacmania' has a default setting of 'C' (upright 1 player) while 'pacmanij' has a default setting of 'A' (cocktail) ... dangseed37b16ora Giannis / stephh

WIP:

- 28th November 2002: Paul Priest added the correct graphics ROMs to Dragon Blaze (but it's still missing sound), and he fixed various things in Daraku Tenshi which is now fully playable too.

-  2nd March 2002: Olivier Galibert fixed a few bugs in the SH-2 CPU core which also fix Daraku Tenshi - The Fallen Angels.

- 22nd February 2002: David Haywood reported some more progress with the newer Psikyo games. Most color problems are fixed, Sol Divide also works and Daraku Tenshi - The Fallen Angels also works almost up to the actual game but crashes at that point. The background graphics in Strikers 1945 II and Space Bomber are still missing, though.


Possible Bugs:

- daraku, possibly others: Enter into test mode, then into sound test; calling some music data (examples: 0x24 or 0xffff) will make the game hang, unless you press the reset button. In-game bug? daraku063red Kale

0.37b10 [David Graves]


NOTE:

- Sometimes music will be replaced with a loop of explosion sounds, this happens in the intro, and some other places too eg. the 2nd boss. Sometimes the sound is a bit strange and sometimes only on one channel is present !? (left) Sometimes it sounds like some random effects are played... "Bodysonic" speakers are installed in seats of the Darius II cabinet. Bass sounds are for them, and not a bug. Fujix


Bugs:

- Some graphics don't disappear correctly. If you load the game up and let it run through attract mode for a few seconds, the crafts will streak across the bottom of the screen and leave a trail. This is probably normal, but about half of the lower craft's streak doesn't disappear if you start inserting coins while the streak(s) are on the screen. It stays there during gameplay. darius2056gre Smitdogg

TODO:

* Correct colors


NOTE:

- Press button 1 to fire. Press and hold button 2 to determine the distance of the shot fired.

- The lives dip switch appears to be labeled incorrectly. When it's set to 2, you get 5 lives, when it's set to 3, you get 6 lives, and so on. The extended play switch is incorrect as well, for example when it's set to 10,000, you get an extra life every 4,000 and every 10,000 points. Your score jumps to 20,000 as soon as you kill your first ememy. All occur if the last Unknown DIP is set to on. The 'bug' if there is one, is that this particular DIP is referenced in the Centuri licensed version (which has less buggy code). All the effects that occur when the Unknown DIP is set to on also occur if the Start with 20000 points switch is on in ddayc. El Condor


Possible Bugs:

- dday.c dday: Once the score exceeds 98,000 points, you start receiving extra lives at an extremely rapid rate. The extra life music plays repeatedly, corrupting other sounds that are trying to play, and the remaining lives counter constantly flashes random symbols. Once you exceed 99,999 points, the score rolls back to 0 and you stop receiving extra lives. Note that in this game it's possible to LOSE points by letting the lifeboats reach the beach (each one loses 200 points). If you go below 0, it again wraps to 99,999, causing lives to be received again. dday077gre HotWax


WIP:

- 0.77u2: Add 'Start with 20000 Pts' and better 'Lives' dipswitches.

- 15th November 2003: El Condor fixed some inputs in D-Day and Cisco Heat.

- 0.53: Correct gfx1/4 roms addresses and change d2_67.bin to a user1 rom. Correct palettesize from 512 to 256 colors.

-  4th August 2001: Zsolt Vasvari converted D-Day to tilemap system and added shadow support to it.

- 11th March 2000: Zsolt Vasvari wrote functions for global sound enable and modified MCR and D-Day drivers to use them.

- 27th April 1999: Zsolt Vasvari made D-Day much faster.

- 0.35b11: Zsolt Vasvari made several fixes and improvements to D-Day and added original D-Day (Olympia).

- 0.33b4: Zsolt Vasvari fixed sound in D-Day.

0.37b5 [Luca Elia]


NOTE:

- Suffers noticable slowdowns. "Dodonpachi slows down very noticably when things get a bit hectic on screen (which is very often), .. even as soon as a few seconds into the game. The emulation is reporting that it is able to keep up with the game (ie : a solid 60fps / 100%) .. .. the slowdown seems to come from the game itself and not the emulation". In the Cave games the slowdown is intentional. How on earth would you otherwise be able to dodge all the bullets flying on the screen and still kill enemies ;-) - Gridle

- There are no DSWs.


WIP:

DIP/Input Bugs:

- Clone ghunter: Controls don't work properly. The cursor stands in the top-left corner and can't be moved. Oddly, in service mode, controls work!

Update: Analog controls respond now but they're really screwy. ghunter067gra Kale / Haze

WIP:

- 0.77u3: R. Belmont added YMF271 sound core plus very preliminary hook up in ms32.c (only Desert War makes any sound at all and it doesn't really seem to be anytihng like correct, this is probably due to a combination of z80 communication and banking issues).

- 0.63: Correct gfx3 roms addresses.

Bugs:

- There are some sprite zooming problems. Just look at the planes in the 2nd stage (their 2 half are over each other). I've attached a three snaps for it. The first one shows the right half of the planes appearing like cutted. Then there's a distance where the plane looks perfect (the exact size of the sprite). However when the planes get closer, the bug appears again. It might be some kind of bug with the maths of sprite scaling. devstors37b6gre YMI / Pi

SETUP:

- The first time you run the game, it will say '33 TIP...EXIT = SHIFT LEVER'. Press F3 to proceed.


NOTE:

- Your place in the race never changes from 1/1. Also, it displays a "1st place" screen when you finish the race and then game over. It's because this game has the possibility of linking up several (four if I'm not wrong) cabinets for playing multiplayer games. The 1/1 is because you are currently playing alone. If you are playing with another player, regardless of how many CPU cars you get past, if your opponent is ahead of you in the race at the end of the play time, you are 2/2, viceversa 1/2. But unluckly I don't think that MAME supports link plays... Kale


DIP/Input Bugs:

- Your car always turns left regardless of which direction you press on your keyboard/joystick. Happens in .62 & .63, but not .61 & earlier. dirtfoxj063gra easymode / uRebelScum

Samples required


Bugs:

- Startup sound is wrong (should be Mario's jump sound). When Mario runs, the sound of his footsteps should change slightly in pitch (high, medium, low, high, medium, low, high, low, repeat). This is checked against my DK board. This is the DK startup sequence: When the board is powered on, there is garbage in video ram, which is displayed upside down, mario's jump sound is heard, then the title screen (everything is right-side up now). If the board is reset during a game, the last thing in video RAM is shown upside down, then mario's jump sound, then the normal title screen. (these bugs have been there for a very long time) dkong36b15gre MC68K


WIP:

- 21st January 2003: Derrick Renaud modifyed the Donkey Kong sounds a little.

- 0.62: Added clone Donkey Kong (US set 2).

- 17th June 2002: Mike Haaland added the original US ROM set of Donkey Kong which includes the ladder trick.

- 0.53: Correct Donkey Kong colors (Proms $0, $100, $200 - palette low 4 bits (inverted), palette high 4 bits (inverted) and character color codes). Rename (dkongjpo) to (dkongjo1) and add clone dkongjo.

- 17th April 2000: Zsolt Vasvari fixed a Donkey Kong graphics bug.

- 0.36b13: Added clone Donkey Kong (Japan set 2).

- 23rd August 1999: Mike Coates fixed Donkey Kong sounds.

- 0.35b6: Change audio I8039 CPU2 to I8035.

- 0.34b6: Andrew Scott added decay to Donkey Kong.

- 0.34b4: Mirko Buffoni fixed sound pitch and tempo in Donkey Kong.

- 0.31: Howie Cohen and Brad Oliver fixed sound pitch and Mario jump in Donkey Kong. Wiebo de Wit fixed scores over 100000 in Donkey Kong/Donkey Kong Jr.

- 0.30: Ron Fries, Dan Boris and Mirko Buffoni support 8039 emulator, and _emulated_ sound in Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Mario Bros. Since the boards also use discrete circuits to generate sound, some samples are still needed to get complete sound support. Also partial sound in Radarscope.

- 0.29: Nicola Salmoria made minor fix to Donkey Kong colors (black was dark blue).

- 0.28: Merged Dkong and Dkong 3 driver and vidhrdw driver. Colors in Donkey Kong are now 100% accurate. Several people complained that girders should be pink instead of red, but to the best of my knowledge the current colors are an accurate conversion of the color PROMs, and this has been confirmed by some people. There might be two different versions of Donkey Kong, with slightly different colors. If someone has a "pink" board and wants to read the PROMs from there, I'll be happy to include them.

- 0.27: Nicola made better colors in Donkey Kong has. Are they entirely accurate?

- 0.20: Ron Fries created a new set of Donkey Kong samples, using Mike Cuddy's 8039 emulator. And Paul Berberich fixed some colors of Donkey Kong that is now quite close to original arcade.

- 0.14: Ron Fries added preliminary sound support to Donkey Kong. It uses some very bad samples in a in a separate archive.

- 0.08: Nicola is beginning to understood how the character colors are selected in Donkey Kong and started to fixing them. It based on the Kong emulator by Gary Shepherdson.

- 0.03: Donkey Kong support (wrong colors, no sound).

This happens when you jump over one of the lightbolts or when you knock the apple off and it hits one of bolts. Even if you die in this field and you have to start over again, the background music is still gone. It has probably something to do with the fact that the above actions produce a little notification sound because you gained some points. dkongjr36finalgre Quicks


Possible Bugs:

- On the second level (the one with the chains and the keys) the Donkey Kong Jr character sometimes goes through the keys while pushing them up. dkongjr37b9gre Chad H


WIP:

0.12 [Brad Oliver]


TEST MODE:

- Keep LCTRL pressed and hit F3 to enter Test-Mode.


NOTE:

- In Mr. Do's Castle, the screen proudly displays: CONGRATURATIONS when you win a credit via a diamond. Happens on the real machine...


DIP/Input Bugs:

- In the course of trying to figure out exactly why Mr. Do's Castle doesn't run correctly (it appears to be a race condition, as increasing the "speed" of the CPUs from 4 MHz to 4.0075 MHz also fixes the "lives" problem), I noticed that the schematic for the machine shows three CPUs, but the current driver only implements two. Any hardware types out there better at reading the schematics than I care to determine what the missing third CPU did and whether it's the cause of the lives problem? In the mean time, I'm really tempted to fix docastle by using the CPU speedup hack, as given variations in crystals and trimming caps I know the "higher" speed is well within the tolerance range of the parts running on the actual machine and I seem to recall the Mr. Do's Castle machine we had in the arcade in my dorm (God, that was 16 years ago now) had the same problem; I specifically remember us asking the vending guy to up the number of lives supplied and it not working properly no matter what he set the DIP switches to... Update: The dip switch bugs that are listed by BillK only happen in the later versions of MAME. I've tested Mr Do's Castle on MAME .36b4 and most versions below that and the dips switches work without any problems. The dip switch that is listed as unknown is used, unknown dip switch setting are: OFF - Gives you 8000 points for collecting the diamond and an extra credit and you move on to the next level. ON - Gives you 8000 points for the diamond, you dont get an extra credit and just carry on playing the level as normal. This dip switch setting is the same as the "special" dip switch in Mr Do!, they do the same thing. Update: This also affects the games Dorunrun and clones as well as Spiero. The difference is you get 5 lives when the Dip is set to 3 lives. The odd thing with dorunrun is the bug does not always occur. Sometimes you'll start with 3 lives but most of the time it's 5 lives. Update: When the game is first loaded, it will always start with the same number of lives. Occasionally, after resetting the game with F3, the game will start with the correct number of lives. Once the game is in this state all subsequent games played will also have the correct number of lives. To get the correct number of lives, you might only have to reset the game once or as much as ten or more times. This seems the bug has something to do with a random variable in the game's initialization sequence. docastle055gra Remy / BillK / Stupper / BSR


WIP:

- 0.69: Lee Taylor added clone Mr. Do's Castle (older).

- 0.56: Added third Z80 CPU (function not clear).

- 0.30: Tatsuyuki Satoh and Nicola Salmoria cleaned up the SN76496 emulation, now it is similar to the 8910 one and all games use Tatsuyuki's code. This affects several games, most notably the Mr. Do! series.

- 0.27: Increased the maximum number of digital audio channels from 8 to 16, so there are no more missing voices in the Mr. Do! games/clones (Castle, Run Run, and Kick Rider). Added support for Mr'Do vs Unicorns (earlier version of Do's Castle). Thanks to Lee Taylor for info.

- 0.26a: Thanks to Gary Walton, Nicola added 100% correct colors in Mr Do's Castle.

They are still considered "joystick" inputs though, so if you want to use them you have to redefine the controls in the Joystick menu. This is a minor annoyance that was needed to allow interfacing a Discs of Tron controller to the mouse port (spinner + up and down switches) while still using joystick buttons 1 and 2 for fire and deflect.

0.79u1 [Aaron Giles]

0.74u2 [?]


WIP:

- 0.79u1: Added 3x TMS32031 CPUs.

-  7th February 2004: Aaron Giles - Submitted the finished Driver's Edge driver a couple of days ago. It's not 100% perfect, but I'm tired of trying to understand the hacks they put in so they could use the standard Incredible Technologies blitter chip and make it do some 3D. It appears they modified the firmware a bit so you can specify left and right slopes, and then tacked on some external hardware to implement a Z buffer. It's also interesting how they render the stripes on the road. Each chunk of road is assigned a 5-bit value in the Z buffer, and they render the stripes with a special flag that says "only draw this if the underlying pixel has the same 5-bit value that I assigned to the corresponding chunk of roadway". That was kind of hard to figure out. But the game is totally playable now, and I managed to speed it up to average about 30fps on my P4 3GHz, so it's slower than Cruisin' USA but not in the same league as, say, California Speed.

-  6th February 2004: Aaron Giles fixed up Driver's Edge in the itech32 driver, it's fully playable now.

-  3rd February 2004: Aaron Giles - Getting better.... Figured out the faux Gouraud shading on the polygons. There are still some Z buffering issues, which should hopefully reveal the mountains in the background that are getting rendered over, and fix some other annoyances. I managed to figure out the rest of the controls, so the game is actually quite playable if you can see past the graphics flaws. Z buffering kind of mostly figured out. Still some flags I'm not quite sure of, but there is a background now and not just plain old sky. Unlike the previous shots, this one was done during actual play, not during an attract mode sequence.

-  1st February 2004: Aaron Giles - Well, the polygons are rendering now, but I think there is some texturing that I just can't figure out. Also, the game (which is, in fact, Driver's Edge, as some have speculated) requires exquisite timing between the main CPU and the two TMS320C31 DSPs. Right now it runs for a few frames and then stops rendering for a few frames before picking up again, leading to a pretty jerky experience, all at the amazing speed of around 12fps on my P3 3GHz.

- 31st January 2004: Aaron Giles - After many years of occasional poking and prodding, I've finally managed to get some gameplay to show up in Driver's Edge!

Bugs:

- On level 8, only some sprites should be visible thru darkness, like blue diamonds on the red octopus, backs of those light-beatles before end, etc... the rest should be under darkness and visible only in the light-cone of the dragon ... (I do believe that previous versions of MAME got it right, just .61 is bugged). See inp file and snapshots. dspirit061gre Ped

GAME START:

- Press key 5 or 6 and shoot on 1-Player or 2-Player game to start.


Bugs:

- duckhunt, pc_duckh: On the 1st level of the game where the dog jumps into the bushes, you are supposed to hear him 'bark' three times. In MAME, the sound is barely audible and he only barks once. The ducks also have a 'quack' sound that is missing in MAME. Upon further investigation, I found that after the one very faint bark noise is heard... the 'Nintendo' sound processor no longer plays this sound again or the quack sounds even after reset. duckhunt061ora Darkk


WIP:

- 0.66: Correct DIP switches in Vs. Duck Hunt.

-  1st January 2001: Howie Cohen finally submitted the long awaited VSNES driver, with most of the games having correct colors and sound.

- GAME C: 3 shots per two clay pigeons!

- Please return the gun to the holster before you leave!

Bugs:

- When this set was added to MAME, it started using the Japanese clone's gfx ROMs, assuming they are were the same in both sets. The gfx ROMs for the world version weren't dumped and most likely were different, regardless of Capcom's track record. Check the dump notes in Guru's Dynasty Wars dump that hasn't yet been added. Glitches happen currently, for example: There's a bit of graphical garbage at the final score tally (should be "" then nothing, since there is no Level 9) if you've reached Level 8. Score is displayed properly at the end of any previous level where you happen to get to Level 8 ( see snapshot). dw067gre big_lenny_c / Smitdogg

Bugs:

- The guard button does not work correctly. A few examples-"Walking" (moving around the opponent while facing them) is done by holding Guard and using the joystick. Play the game in MAME and you will find that you just use the joystick (it is not neccesary to hold any button). This also makes it impossible to run, as running requires no buttons to be held down. "Fully Crouch" you are supposed to hold down Guard to crouch and block low. In MAME, your character is in a crouching/low block stance all the time (with no player input). "Rolling", to roll while standing, you are supposed to hold Guard and tap twice in any direction. In MAME, you can just tap twice in any direction to roll, no button has to be held down. The inputs require a cpu core which hasn't been added to MAME yet, so the driver is simulating the response that it would produce. There are also issues with coins not always working. Whether I'll get a chance to figure out whats going on, I don't know. It might even be something more complicated, like protection or banking issues. ehrgeiz079u1yel hellspit / smf

0.34b1 [Al Kossow]


SETUP and TEST MODE:

- The first time you run the game, it will ask the language. You can use F1 to proceed through all the configuration screens, or just reset (F3). To change the language afterwards, delete the ELECYOYO.NV file from the NVRAM directory and re-run the program.

- Keep F2 pressed to enter test mode, then F1 to advance to the next test.

- There are no dip switches, press F1 to enter the service mode, then F1=Next screen, F2=Next line, F5=Up and F6=Down.


Bugs:

- The attract mode hangs after 30 seconds. elecyoyo055yel MASH

0.18 [Nicola Salmoria]


WIP:

- 22nd November 1999: Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed a cpu interleaving problem in Elevator Action.

- 0.35b3: Correct M68705 CPU3 clock speed to 1.5MHz.

- 0.34b1: Nicola Salmoria made the original Elevator Action now works, using the 68705 mcu ROM which was missing. Since there is one additional CPU to emulate, it is slower than the bootleg version.

- 0.33b6: Nicola Salmoria removed the partially working protection emulation in Elevator Action, so people will hopefully understand that it doesn't work and use the bootleg instead.

- 0.29: Nicola Salmoria emulates the hardware of the Taito games (Elevator Action, Jungle King, Wild Western, Front Line) more faithfully. Playfield priority is accurate in Jungle King, however this broke Wild Western - strange. Front Line works. Merged all the drivers into taito.c

- 0.27: Elevator action sound is perfect now. Elevator Action, Jungle King and Wild Western now use the same video hardware driver (taito.c)

- 0.26: Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed sound tempo speed in Elevator Action (tempo speed is 37.5Khz).

- 0.25: Nicola did some fixes to Taito Games (Jungle King and Elevator Action) about background placement and coins per credit dipswitch. Plus vertical scroll support in Jungle King (used in ground shake), correct sprite priority, and no more rubbish is present during change of stage.

- 0.22: Fixed credit bugs in Elevator Action and Turtles. Added preliminary sound support to Elevator Action and Jungle King.

- 0.21.5: Nicola fixed colors in Elevator Action (100% correct colors).

- 0.21: Fixed Dipswitch in Elevator Action.

- 0.20: Fixed missing sprites when exiting from doors in Elevator Action. There are still some sprite priority bugs. Also better colors.

- 0.19: Nicola Salmoria found how Elevator Action background works. Also updated all drivers that have a scrolling background. Support for the bootleg version of Elevator Action ("elevatob"). The original version doesn't work because of copy protection. The graphics are almost OK now, albeit quite slow.

- 0.18: VERY preliminary support for Elevator Action. Not playable.


STORY:

- Agent 17 code name "OTTO" is to secure top secret documents from the security building. Enemy spys are in pursuit, and their orders are to stop him at any cost. After reaching the tip of a 30 story building, Agent 17 has to make his way down to the basement and the awaiting getaway car. Otto is relyinmg on your skills so GOOD Luck!


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- The object of the game is to make it through the building, get secret documents, & get to an awaiting getaway car. You can use the jump kick button to dodge bullets and kick bad guys. Use the fire button to stop enemy agents. Go in the red doors for surprise bonus points. You must go through all red doors to get the top secret documents, or you can't escape.

Samples required


Bugs:

- elim2, elim2a: During gameplay there is a blue dot in the centre of the screen. This does NOT affect the clone elim4. elim2055gre Fever


DIP/Input Bugs:

- Clone elim4: The startup behavior for this game has not been working properly. The 1st coin slot incorrectly credits all four players instead of just player 1. It should be possible to start any combination of a 1, 2, 3 or 4 player game. Pushing Coin 3 eight or more times will start the countdown for Player 4. If you continue to rapidly press the other coin buttons it's possible to get a 2 or 3 player game started. Here is a description of the correct behavior from www.gamearchive.com: "No player start buttons were needed. There was a coin door for each side of the cabinet under each player's controls. The coin mechs have lockout coils, so as soon as a player put a coin in, the coin door would lock out attempts to coin up that side again, and the player would use that side. A countdown from 10 would begin, and other players could coin in before it reached 0. Once it reached zero, players could not join, and any remaining attempts to coin in would be locked out." elim4054gra BSR

- 0.27: Al Kossow and Brad Oliver provided drivers for the Sega vector games (Eliminator, Space Fury, Star Trek, Tac-Scan, Zektor). Partial sound support (speech) is available through samples for some of them.


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- Shoot enemy ships with your energy bolt

Bugs:

- I've got the REAL music from REAL board. Everybody can easily notice the music is obviously strange in MAME if you hear that. Especially please check the part from 5 min. 27 sec of the mp3 file. It is the sound played when you are killed. You'll notice that there's a cuckoo clock sound. In MAME it's just noise. (mp3 file got corrupted and is missing at the moment, sorry). empcity36finalgre Fujix

- The current speed is too slow in MAME. One great fan of the empcity said originally you can't avoid enemies' shots so easily like MAME, and it's not such a leisurely shoot-out game. He can't say the real speed definitly, but the real speed is about twice as fast as MAME surely. empcity36finalyel Fujix

- The boss stage following round 8 does not work the first time you try it. It does work after you go back through round 8 a second time. This does not happen in the clones empcityj or stfight. empcity055gre Markie / TriggerFin

0.34b8 [Brad Oliver]


Bugs:

- The game Empire Strikes Back has some definite sound issues. The big problem is that the music will get caught and keep playing when it should change. For example, after you select your level of difficulty, it shows Vader's ship with "The Imperial March" intro playing in the background, when you start with the probots, the music should change but it doesn't. Sometimes it will change when you get to the Imperial walker stage or until you get to the tie fighter stage. When you get to the asteroids stage, the music doesn't play at all! When you spell out JEDI, that music will keep playing regardless of stage. Lastly, in the attract mode, when the ESB logo comes up and tells the story of Luke, it should be playing "Leia's theme" or the love theme to Empire (not sure of music titles) in the background but doesn't (regardless of the demo sounds dip switch setting). I did compare this to the arcade version and it is incorrect. Other than that, the game plays fine. This happens around 75% of the time. esb065gre Hermaphrodite


WIP:

- 0.58: Correct palettesize from 256 to 32768 colors.

- 23rd June 1999: Mathis Rosenhauer fixed the Empire Strikes Back mathbox chip, and the 3D vectors aren't anymore corrupt sometimes.

- 22nd June 1999: Marco Cassili fixed the dipswitches in Empire Strikes Back. Nicola Salmoria fixed the slapstic problems in Xybots, and fixed Empire Strikes Back from hanging at the highscore screen.

- 21st June 1999: Nicola Salmoria finally fixed Empire Strikes Back's slapstic issues, and the game itself is playable!

- 0.34b8: Brad Oliver added The Empire Strikes Back (not playable).


STORY:

- It is a dark time for the rebels. The Empire has launched thousands of robots in search of the rebel hideout. The Empire fears the strength of the force within one rebel... Luke Skywalker.


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- You begin with enough 'Force' to protect you for 4 collisions.

- 'Force' strength is lost when you collide with enemy shots, walkers and asteroids.

- Aim your lasers with cursor to explode Probots, Transmissions, Walker, Tie Fighters and shots.

- Avoid collision with asteroids by flying around them.

WIP:

- 24th August 2000: Zsolt Vasvari converted Exed Exes and Mysterious Stones to the tilemap system.

- 0.37b6: Added proms ($800, $900, $a00 and $b00 - interrupt/video timing (not used), unknown (all 0) and unknown (priority?)).

-  6th August 2000: Nicola Salmoria implemented correct tile/sprite priority system in Bionic Commando, Exed Exes, Ghosts 'n Goblins and Last Duel.

- 11th February 1999: Mirko Buffoni has made the interpolation stuff even better. Exed Exes example is about doubling with 50% transparent scanlines (left side), and Mr. Do! example is about doubling with linear interpolation (both sides) and 50% transparent scanlines (left side). All these things are of course off by default.

-  6th February 1999: Mirko Buffoni has made interpolation routines for MAME. You'll need a powerful machine for this: (it's like ZSNES).

- 0.31: Nicola Salmoria fixed sound in Exed Exes; it has one 8910 and two 76496, not two 8910.

- 0.29: Nicola Salmoria added the missing scrolling background to Exed Exes.

- 0.28: Many thanks to Luis Longeri for helpful tips about Exed Exes' background, which is now partially working.

- 0.27: Preliminary Exed Exes support, implemented by Richard Davies. Thanks to Paul Swan, it has 100% accurate colors.To do: find where tile ram is located and how it works, and whether banked ROMs contain code or only data. The structure of this game is similar to the other Capcom games.

NOTE:

- exerion, exeriont, exerionb: Obscure bonus bug. Many thanks to George Anastasiadis. This information was taken from here. There is a notorious bug. In the challenge stage, if you shoot all 40 aliens you normally get a bonus charge of 60. Sometimes a red hydra comes out during this stage. If you shoot it and all 40 aliens, you get a total of 41. The game seems to fail the test of 'hits=40' and only gives you a bonus charge of 41. This information was taken from here. gregf

Bugs:

- Small brown boxes that seem to be graphic glitches appear on the slopes, beginning on Course 2. Screenshot linked, an example can be see just to the right of the fire, above the player. Possible bad dump/stuck bits? extdwnhl37b16gre Smitdogg

- After you've finished the 1st race, in one of the following screens which shows everyone's place in the race, if you press the brake button to get it to clear, there is a line of graphics at the top of the screen that doesn't clear in time correctly. Check the screenshots, taken about 1-2 seconds apart. extdwnhl058gre Smitdogg

TODO:

* NO GOOD DUMP KNOWN:  extr8742.bin (cpu3)


Possible Bugs:

- In extrmatn, in gameplay whenever you catch a "T" you become invisible and inmune to the enemies, and the players should be blinking for a few seconds, but instead you completely disappear, other times just nothing happens, as if it skipped half the frames. It must be a skipping problem because the movement of the sprites is not smooth at all, even though you enable V-sync. I am sure it is not a processor speed problem, as it happens when frameskip is set to zero. extrmatn237b15gre Stivy

0.79u2 [David Haywood]


WIP:

- 17th April 2004: Philip Bennett - Improved the 2D video emulation. The difference isn't noticeable in screenshots, but believe me, it runs a lot smoother now. 

- 12th April 2004: Philip Bennett - Cleaned up the memory maps slightly and managed to get the TMS/68000 monitor modes running. I haven't had much of a chance to work on the games recently. Hopefully that should change in a couple of weeks time...

-  3rd April 2004: Philip Bennett - I've hastily transferred Steve Ellenoff's i8051 PinMAME core over to MAME. As a result, F-15SE and B.O.T.S.S start up with some DAC humming and what sounds like FM machine-gun fire and bell chimes. Given that the 68000 and 8031 aren't communicating properly, that's the extent of the current sound emulation. As an interesting aside, the TMS34010, 68000 and Am29000 each have their own UART device for serial communication with a computer connected to one of the three 'monitor' ports. Diagnostic/status text sent via the ports prints out quite nicely to the command prompt. There's code in the ROMs for some comprehensive system tests initiated presumably via the computer. They should prove rather useful once I bother to get them running.

-  1st April 2004: Philip Bennett - With a few minor adjustments, the remaining 2D graphics have in F-15 Strike Eagle appeared. After patching out its 68000<->Am29000 communications code, B.O.T.S.S makes an appearance... I've been informed (thanks Thomas!) that there's an i8051 core in PinMAME, supporting the i80C31 MCU. Sound emulation *may* follow soon. I'm expecting thumping FM techno soundtracks from both games.

- 30th March 2004: Philip Bennett - Working on F-15 Strike Eagle for the past few weeks. Currently, the 68000 and TMS34010 are hooked up. The game starts with a bit of high kludgery, but without an Am29000 core (a 32-bit RISC CPU responsible for generating the 3D objects) it's far from playable. In addition, an 80C31 MCU core is needed for sound emulation. Battle of the Solar System and Super Tank Attack run on similar hardware, but there's not a lot to show from them at the moment. I've began writing an Am29000 core (it disassembles code at the moment), but with the sheer amount of academic work I'm lumbered with at the moment progress will be slow.

TODO:

Bugs:

- rollrace, fightrol: When you insert your initials, the scrolling bar of initials does not work properly. Basically, the letter you scroll to select is generally not going to the one that shows up. rollrace37b12gre SportsDude


Possible Bugs:

- In both Fighting Roller and Roller Aces, when you hit a enemy skater while going at full speed, the game says that's worth 2000 points, but you only get 1000 points. Also, when you run over a money bag in Roller Aces, no points are given for that. IIRC, the money bag was worth something, but I'm not 100% sure (it's been a LONG time since I played this game in the arcade). This bug doesn't exist in Fighting Roller, since there is a brown boulder in place of the money bag (and you still fall when you run over it). rollracec37b13gre The tECHIDNA

0.36b8 [Keith Wilkins]


Bugs:

- Some of the graphics aren't being drawn. I landed on invisible objects (see snapshot). Update: This happens when you let the level introduction run (the briefing). It seems that the foreground tilemap isn't aligned correctly. If you press the button quick enough, the graphics are aligned correctly. finehour053gre Smitdogg / Kale

- In level 2, if you let the briefing run, you can't move from the starting position. finehour053gre4 Kale


Possible Bugs:

- After a continue, the level title remains on screen without fading out. Is it supposed to remain when starting a play too, it isn't supposed to remain at all or it is the correct behaviour??? finehour069u3gre Kale

- The title screen roz-tilemap has (at least) wrong horizontal zooming. In theory the word "Finest Hour" should cover the two edges of the screen, current implementation makes an extra "r^tm" appear to the left and a "F" to the right. finehour069u3gre2 Kale

- Some bigger enemies seems to have bad colors; they are completely black (except for some parts) and on some of them you can hit some parts but they don't change their color even when they are destroyed. For example the first level "boss" is completely black in level 1, but in level 4 you can see the same enemy but with blue shades. Probably the real thing should have brighter colours. Another example is when you meet the turrets in level 1; if you notice it, there are other turrets of the same kind in the background, and they have correct colors (they are gray). finehour069u3gre3 Kale

- 0.35b3: Added Fire One (Exidy 1979).

-  9th February 1999: Here is a (real) story what true emulator freaks can do to help preserving old arcade games, and to document the arcade games' history. The fellow who dumped the roms of Fire One had to drive 5 hours (each way) to get the board from a leaky garage which had been used by cats as a litter box. Half of the eproms had corroded pins and the smell was probably very disgusting (Maybe he should mail the board to IDSA  *evil grin* - http://www.idsa.org/. He got the roms dumped, and then the newest addition to MAME team, Olivier Galibert, started furiously working on the game. As a nice side effect, Star Fire also works much better (with trails though). Still no sound in either of these games, and it seems very unlikely that the samples could be extracted from that non-functioning board...

0.37b12 [Phil Stroffolino]


SETUP: 

- Select Fire Truck (2 Player) or Smokey Joe (1 Player) in the dipswitch menu. Two drivers work as a team to control a hook-and-ladder fire engine. One player drives the cab, the other steers the trailer simulating the excitement of an actual fire chase. A single player can choose to drive either the cab or the trailer. In this mode, the computer takes over as the alternate driving partner.


NOTE:

- Service mode is completely scrambled. The service mode is supposed to look like this, from the manual: "throughout the self-test, a set of stationary graphics appear in a rainbow pattern (dark to light) from the left side to the right side of the screen". I mixed this with Monte Carlo (same driver). That game has a very similar service mode which is confirmed by screen shots in the manual. Anyway, the emulation is correct. frotz

-  7th February 2001: Phil Stroffolino added collision detection to Fire Truck, but it still unfortunately does not work with the C 6808/6800 core.

-  5th February 2001: Phil Stroffolino sent in a Fire Truck driver based on Ron Fries' and Dan Boris' original work, but the game does not start because of CPU core bugs and it also lacks collision detection.

Bugs:

- If you die, sometimes sounds will play. This happens if those sounds were played a second or so before. i played this game until level 7(not the inp.. where i just die) and only heard explosions, barks(dog), and bullet sound... no other sounds. The sounds play like this usually when these things happen: 1) A robotic bird (or the rocket-pack guy) drops missiles to the ground; 2) The dogs bark; 3) One of the gangster guys fires his gun (they start doing this in stage 5, I think); 4) The boss at the end of a level fires the weapon that turns you into stone. flashgal37b4gre Jonemaan/ The tECHIDNA

Bugs:

- After starting a game, the sound cuts off. Not in 36 final. Doesn't happen on the other sets of Frogger. froggermc054yel Karasu


Possible Bugs:

- Clone frogg: Sometimes when you die the Galaxian starfield appears in the background. Generally on Galaxian board hacks you cut a pin that disables the starfield completely, so I would be very surprised if the original board does this, but you never know. frogg059gre Darkk / dwidel

Bugs:

- Mahjong Gakuensai - There are several graphics glitches throuout the game, for instance, when you're playing Mahjong with one of the women, and it scrolls up to their face, you can see a glitched pattern. After this, you can see glitches at the top of the screen during the game of Mahjong. Also, When you are getting photos from a guy, and it scrolls away from him, there is a block glitch. Lastly, when you take a picture of any of the topless females, there mouth is flashing (happens with all of them). See Screenshots. gakusai056gre Karasu

- The in-game scrolling effects in gakusai (Mahjong Gakuensai) display corrupt graphics until the scroll is finished. This only seems to affect the in-game scrolling - the scroll when you meet your first challenger works just fine. Screenshot 1. Screenshot 2. gakusai37b16gre erik

- gakusai, gakusai2: All music played has the drum machine playing VERY loudly and all other instruments playing VERY softly, to the point that they are barely audible. This also affects a few non-vocal sound effects. Doesn't affect other games in metro.c. gakusai066ora MAMEjong

0.05 [Nicola Salmoria]


Bugs:

- Background sound speeds up too fast too quickly - I actually noticed this in the last beta cycle and it still exists in this one. I don't know when it first originated. Update (MAME .67): In case this has been forgotten, there are still a couple of issues with the background 'hum'. 1) Compared to the start-up jingle, the hum is about 1/2 the volume level of that tune. On mame, it is probably at about the same level as the start-up jingle. Very noticable when the galaxians are attacking. Their sound is drowned by the background hum. The "background hum" should be exactly that - background. Also, the way in which it speeds up is interesting. It speeds up slowly upto a maximum - probably at about 40 seconds. The speed at any point seems to be unaffected by what's going on. If you die, it sounds the same at the point you restart. When the galaxians go into free-fall, you can barely here the background sound as the sound level is cut dramatically. galaxian37b15gre Tony Clifton / Gary Walton

- 0.18: Nicola added some lousy, very inaccurate, noise to the 76496 emulator. This affects Lady Bug, Green Beret, Galaxian, Pisces, Moon Cresta, Moon Quasar.

- 0.15: Added support for a version of Galaxian which is known to be original. It has Namco copyright and the code is slightly different from the other Galaxian (which has Midway copyright). I called this version "galaxian", and renamed the other "galmidw".

- 0.06: Star background in Galaxians & co. The way Nicola calculate it is probably not correct, anyway it looks reasonable.

- 0.05: Support for Galaxians and the plethora of clones (correct colors, limited sound)

STORY:

- On the distant planet of Gaston, a ruthless dictator named Gildy rose to power. After the takeover of the local planetary neighbors, Gildy began a compaign to ruthlessly occupy the galaxy of Galmedes. The Gastonian military and colonizing forces reported a substantial amount of success with the first invasion. A dedicated team of Galmedian scientists labored desperately to create a weapon capable of destroying Gastonian forces. They finally succeded in creating LEPTON ( Launched Electro-Projectile Thermal Osmotic Nullifier). LEPTON was capable of emitting a sub-lightspeed projectile which would infiltrate the enemy target by osmotic means, then create a nullifying field of set volumem destroying the enemy in the progress. The Galmedian people were now prepared and ready for invading Gastonians. And here the story begins...

NOTE:

- Easter egg: Enter service mode, keep P1 start and P1 button pressed and move joystick left until sound reaches 19, then (c) 1984 NAMCO will appear on the screen.


Bugs:

- In reverse scrolling stages after challenging stages, the background should scroll at high speed. And when you get the Elephant-head (Blaster-Head that appears at PARSEC 16 first), the background also doesn't scroll at high speed in MAME. Scrolling speed in real board is as same as players speed with Hyper-Head. gaplus36rc2gre Fujix

WIP:

- 0.80: Fix dipswitches and remove unknown dips.

- 0.78u5: Stefan Jokisch fixed the bad ram message in Green Beret (0.78u2 memory rewrite).

- 17th June 2003: Gerald Coy fixed the ROM names in Green Beret.

- 12th October 2001: Phil Stroffolino fixed the tilemap bug which caused the Green Beret cocktail mode problem.

-  4th April 2001: Quench fixed a graphics scrolling bug in Green Beret bootleg.

- 0.35b11: Mirko Buffoni added clone Green Beret (bootleg).

- 0.18: The speed should now be VERY accurate. It also syncs correctly with the music. Sound pitch should be correct as well (though it changes after you die for the first time...). High score support. Fixed sprite clipping problem on the left of the screen. Fixed memory trashing bug in dirtybuffer handling. Added some lousy, very inaccurate, noise to the 76496 emulator. This affects Lady Bug, Green Beret, Galaxian, Pisces, Moon Cresta, Moon Quasar.

- 0.17: Support for Rush'n Attack (the US version). Various fixes to Green Beret: Thanks to Paul Swan, it now has 100% accurate colors. Dip switches didn't work, fixed. Nicola have been told that it actually was too fast, so now it runs slower. Let him know how accurate it is.

- 0.16: Support for Green Beret, with partial sound (probably inaccurate). Colors are terrible. It's playable (but should it be this fast? I find it very hard).

0.36b5 [Aaron Giles]


DIP/Input Bugs:

- When cabinet is switched to cocktail mode, player 1 controls do not function. Neither mouse nor joystick. Player 2 seems to work. This is not a dual mouse issue because the driver is only set up for X1, and Y1. There aren't any controls defined for player 2. I have the player1 controls working, I think, for player2 but not player1. The mouse won't do anything, but an analog joystick will. I set TrackX and Y of player2 to the second stick, and player1 to the first. the second does nothing, the first controls p2 only. gimeabrk078u3gra southpaw / TriggerFin

Bugs:

The fact is that in level two sometimes appears a sprite (a head) with wrong colors. See the screen shot. Update (MAME .58) : The bug happens with or without using cheats. gladiatr36rc2gre Lord Caos / Smitdogg

WIP:

- 0.37b7: Correct palettesize from 192 to 256 colors.

- 28th August 2000: Zsolt Vasvari added cocktail mode and fixed sprite lag in Legendary Wings / Trojan and Ghosts and Goblins.

- 0.37b6: Added proms ($0, $100 - video timing (not used), priority (not used)).

-  6th August 2000: Nicola Salmoria implemented correct tile/sprite priority system in Bionic Commando, Exed Exes, Ghosts 'n Goblins and Last Duel.

- 0.35RC2: Yasuhiro Ogawa added clones Ghosts'n Goblins (World? set 2), Makai-Mura, Makai-Mura (Revision C) and Makai-Mura (Revision G).

- 20th June 1999: Yasuhiro Ogawa added some new romsets for Ghosts'n'Goblins.

-  5th March 1999: Phil Stroffolino has continued his work on tilemaps, added support for Ghosts'n'Goblins cocktail mode and Gaiden video driver has some fixes.

- 0.34b8: Zsolt Vasvari replaces the old Ghosts'n Goblins set with a new Cross set.

- 0.31: mbeighau@iies.es added Invulnerability dip switch to Japanese Ghosts'n Goblins.

- 0.29: Aaron Giles did some optimizations to the 6809, and modified it to always fetch opcodes directly from RAM (much faster). The Ghosts 'n Goblins, Star Wars and Williams drivers needed reworking to support that.

- 0.27: Support for a GnG version with different graphics (cross instead of shield).

- 0.26a: Ghosts 'n Goblins does the self test.

- 0.23: Gabrio Secco provided the complete colors LOG file for Ghosts 'n Goblins (100% correct). "And there was MUSIC!". Thanks to Ishmair's FM engine, music is supported in Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Diamonds. Since the synthesis is based on FM generation via OPL, you must have a SoundBlaster, Adlib, or compatible to get the music. However Mirko Buffoni heavily dislike this approach and he is looking for documentation on FM generation.

- 0.22: And here it is: thanks to Roberto Ventura's superdetailed documentation Mirko Buffoni added Ghost 'n Goblin support. He lost one week because of a bug in the new 6809 emulator, so he switch back to the previous one. Big thanks to Nicola that fixed some stupid bugs in color palette generation.

Samples required


NOTE:

- Gridlee is a game that was never released. It was developed by Videa, Inc. in 1982, on hardware designed by Howard Delman. Videa was eventually acquired by Pizza Time Theater and formed the core of their new Sente Technologies division. The hardware that Gridlee ran on evolved into the Bally/Sente SAC I system, which provided a cartridge-based arcade gaming platform. Thanks to the kind generosity of the three co-founders of Videa -- Howard Delman, Ed Rotberg, and Roger Hector -- the original PROM images from the only existing Gridlee machine have been made available for free, non-commerical use. The ROMs were dumped from the only known existing prototype, owned by Dale Luck.


WIP:

- 0.58: Added Custom sound and partial support for samples (bounce1 and bounce2.wav).

- 25th May 2001: Aaron Giles sent a driver for Gridlee.


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- Catch as many balls as you can.

- Shoot opponents as they pass overhead (watch their shadows).

- Avoid the charged squares YUMPERZ and FERGIES.

- Watch out for IGOR. He gums up your grid.

STORY:

- It is August 1999. In the skies over the Middle East, the second Persian Gulf War has begun. The early half of the 90's, the Persian Gulf War breaks out in the Middle East and prolonged fighting rapidly increases the rate of destruction of the world's natural resources. In 1999 this develops into a state of crisis where the effects of the war have resulted in an absolute shortage of an reserves. Mistaken policies have resulted in the nation of the Middle East, suffering from shortages since the time of the original Persian Gulf War, taking military action against neighboring nations in an attempt to assure a supply of resources for themselves. Those nations which have managed to escape the fihting once again from a Multinational Force. Using the technology gained from research which had been done for a new type of nuclear reactor, they succeed in developing and producing GRID- a Gyrodrive Reactive Intercept Device. This is the start of Project Storm Hammer.

Bugs:

TODO:

* Add sound/samples (Boot Hill samples?)


Possible Bugs:

- As the game starts, the countdown number timer, will always skip one second and if choosing to reset the game, on an occasion or two, the game may possibly skip by two seconds. For example, if choosing 60 seconds for play time, the game will skip number 59 and show 58 instead. Sometimes it will skip from 60 seconds to 57 seconds. This same pattern also occurs if selecting any of the longer amounts of playing time. Explanation of bug occurrence: (from stephh) Timer is BCD coded at address 0x2004 (range 00-90h) and there is sub-timer NOT BCD coded (range 00-22h) at address 0x2009. Each 2 frames, the sub-timer is decremented. The timer display is updated first at once (when you press '5'), then the different sprites are displayed. Then the timer display is then updated when contents of 0x2004 change. The "problem" is that contents of 0x2009 is not reset to 0x00 when you press '5' and it takes 90 frames to display the sprites, and in the meantime, the display timer isn't updated (but contents of 0x2004 is OK). So, if contents of 0x2009 > 0x0b when you press '5', the display will "jump" from 60 to 58, and if contents of 0x2009 < 0x0c when you press '5', the display will "jump" from 60 to 57. gunfight055gre gregf / stephh

STORY:

- Early in the 22nd Century, human beings enter the years of developing the space. In the 7th developing star, a discovery of space gold attracted many people and they emigrated there. As emigrants had to play an enormous amount of money for their long space travel. Their living style was very much like that in the west of the USA in the 1800's. In 2120 A.D. a planet "Gloria": It was the time when i was very young... I was in the 2nd development group. People lived in peace, having dream and hope. Their peace was but short-lived. Nosing out the gold, space thieves "Wild Lizards" attacked them together with a huge monster tank. Too many people were killed and the servivors were enslaved. No piece of bread was given... Ah! Can anyone save us from this hell...We were awaiting such a person.

Bugs:

- The background in stage 5 is wrong: 1. The background animation is wrong; some layers dont scroll smoothly but with steps of about 50 pixels. 2. When you scroll horizontally, the layers move 'into eachother' (see Savestate). gunnail057gre_1 Jonemaan

- After you kill a boss, sometimes a number of vertical lines will appear (see Screenshot). gunnail057gre_2 Jonemaan

- Some tiles will disappear when you drop a big bomb, they will reappear after the explosion. On stage 5, there's brown 'girders' and when you look at this screenshot the brown girders are gone, you can see a green tank riding on the invisible girder. gunnail057gre_3 Jonemaan

0.20 [Michael Cuddy, Nicola Salmoria]


WIP:

- 0.37b12: Added M6809 CPU2 (2MHz) and correct CPU2/3/4 roms addresses.

- 21st January 2001: Nicola Salmoria added accurate sprite multiplexing emulation to Time Pilot and Gyruss. Gyruss with also emulating the slave 6809.

- 0.34b3: Francesco Caporali added RC filter emulation to Gyruss. This improves some sound effects, e.g. the force field noise.

- 0.30: Full emulated sound in Gyruss. You can remove all the samples, they are no longer needed. Also, music tempo should now be correct. Tatsuyuki Satoh, Fabrice Frances, Nicola Salmoria and Pete Ground completely rewritten the 8910 emulator and interface. This affects a lot of games, but the one which benefits more is Gyruss: it now plays many sound effects which were missing.

- 0.29: Accurate colors in Gyruss. Nicola Salmoria fixed sprite/character priority in Gyruss.

- 0.27: Changed the 8910 sound chip emulation interface to allow updates more frequent than 60 per second. Mirko Buffoni also increased the sampling frequency to 44.1kHz. These changes provide dramatic improvements in sound quality, which you can appreciate in e.g. Gyruss and Pooyan. The price to pay is slower execution. To make things worse, he had to (hopefully temporarily) remove some optimizations, so the above games will probably not run as well as before on slower systems.

- 0.20: Yes!!  Finally Mirko Buffoni wrote a driver for Gyruss, one of his favorite games and one of the reasons why he started emulation. Big special thanks to Michael Cuddy, without help and information this game would probably never be done; and to Nicola Salmoria that fixed some of the sprites bugs that turned him mad and cleaned the code! ;) Changed 8910intf to support 5 PSGs (Gyruss have them!)

0.37b9 [Aaron Giles, Ernesto Corvi]


NOTE:

- Hard Drivin' was the first polygon based driving game, and it's graphics were rendered in software mode. The player was immersed in a 3D world with a very realistic physics model. To achieve a high framerate level, even with the powerfull hardware used, graphics had to be sacrificed, the roadside was just a flat surface and the cars were simple polygons with no textures (one could not have the best of both worlds at this time).


Bugs:

- Sound quits working after you reset the game. Also affects racedriv. harddriv070u1yel Smitdogg / BarnacleEd


WIP:

- 0.80: Quench add adjustments for TMS32010 internal data map in Hard Drivin'. Correct TMS32010 audio clock speed to 5MHz.

- 0.76u1: Aaron Giles added clones Hard Drivin' (compact, rev 1), (compact, British, rev 2), (compact, German, rev 2), (cockpit, rev 1), (cockpit, rev 2), (cockpit, rev 3), (cockpit, Japan, rev 6), (cockpit, Japan, rev 7), (cockpit, British, rev 5), (cockpit, British, rev 6). (cockpit, British, rev 7), (cockpit, German, rev 4) and (cockpit, German, rev 7).

-  3rd January 2003: Aaron Giles sent in another update that gets the 34010-based games working again after yesterday's changes, and he fixed BattleToads and Hard Drivin' to compute the VBLANK duration appropriately.

- 0.62: Added clone Hard Drivin' (compact). Hard Drivin' now playable. Added 68000 CPU5, TMS32010 CPU6 and DAC sound. Correct graphics resolution to 508x384 and sound1 roms order.

-  4th October 2002: Aaron Giles updated the TMS34010, TMS32010, ADSP2100 CPU cores with bugfixes and added emulation for ADSP2101 and DSP32C, added sound to Hard Drivin' and got Race Drivin', Steel Talons and Hard Drivin's Airborne mostly working.

-  3rd December 2001: Aaron Giles fixed a few TMS34010 bugs, fixing the missing sprites in Exterminator and fixing the Hard Drivin' crashes.

- 24th October 2001: Aaron Giles fixed a bug in scanline rendering which affected Turbo, and he fixed Hard Drivin' from crashing randomly.

- 27th January 2001: Aaron Giles added another ROM set to the Hard Drivin' driver but it still suffers from a few small quirks.

-  2nd January 2001: Jarek Burczynski optimized the ADSP2100 core a bit, resulting in a 7 % speed gain on some platforms.

-  8th September 2000: Aaron Giles sent in a new TMS34010 core with a few bugfixes, and finally officially sent the Hard Drivin' / S.T.U.N. Runner driver. The latter is perfect, while the former suffers from no sound and a nasty bug causing the car physics go out of control after a crash. Also included was a preliminary Race Drivin' driver, which unfortunately goes weird as soon as the simulation begins.

- 10th August 2000: Aaron Giles did some brilliant work and finally got the polygon graphics working in the preliminary Hard Drivin' / S.T.U.N. Runner driver, which requires about 2 GHz to run properly.

Bugs:

- The score display shows the 2nd (computer) player's score in both the 1st *and* 2nd players' score spots. The score is kept track of correctly, but there's no way for the player to see what their actual score is until the end of the game. This is either not an actual bug, or a bad dump of one of the program ROMs. I've found the bytes in memory responsible for the scores - player 1 is at 0x305462, player 2 is at 0x305466 (scores are divided by 10). So the problem is that the score isn't being transferred from there to graphics memory (I'd need a decent 68000 disassembly of the program to figure out what's wrong here). Anyone know if the original board actually had this problem? heberpop056gre Ashuime / MrLonghair

- Side-by-side test. MAME is clearly playing the music a tad faster than the PCB. Input from PCB arranged via a high to low level speaker-adapter from a SuperGun, low volume as I couldnt be bothered to turn it up atm. The PCB also has two potentiometers for volume - one for master vol, one for some musical instruments. The scrolling bits of text are due to my digicam acting up and being overly sensitive to light, but you get the idea of what the startup really looks like on the real hardware (see mp3's and video). heberpop080u1ora MrLonghair

TODO:

* Add missing SN76477 sound


WIP:

- 0.82u2: Stefan Jokisch update Nintendo 8080 hardware. The driver has now been split into three parts. A few features that have been missing in Helifire since my last update are back, i.e. the flickering colors when you're shot and the volume decay effect (this affects the melody at the start of a game and a few tunes that can be heard during the bonus scenes every twelve attack waves). The starfield should now scroll at the correct speed, it's only 75% of what it used to be.

- 0.80u2: Stefan Jokisch fixed starfield pattern, confirmed by shots on the flyer and starfield priority (no more stars in the water), various audio and video effects are still missing, including a few which were previously implemented and which I hope to re-add soon, properly hooked up sound CPU (different from the other games), fixed video bugs related to pausing and frame skipping, added partial support for cocktail mode, added IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS and NO_COCKTAIL flags and corrected bonus life DIP. Correct 8080 CPU1 clock speed to 2016000 Hz, graphics resolution to 224x256 and removed 'VR3 height of the sea' and 'VR4 height of the waves' dipswitches.

- 0.76u1: Added DAC sound, potentiometers dipswitches (brightness, height) and correct palettesize from 8 to 1032 colors.

- 24th October 2003: Jarek Burczynski emulated the background/foreground graphics and DAC sound in Heli Fire.

- 0.61: Correct graphics resolution to 224x248.

- 0.58: Added audio I8035 CPU2 (400000 Hz) again.

- 0.37b3: Correct palettesize from 32770 to 8 colors and remove I8035, DAC and SN76477 sound.

- 20th May 2000: Zsolt Vasvari fixed the colors in Heli Fire, and added cocktail support to it.

- 0.36b14: Added audio I8035 CPU2 (400000 Hz) and cpu2 rom.

- 0.36b13: Correct 8080 CPU1 clock speed to 2520000 Hz.

- 21st December 1999: Juergen Buchmueller fixed games using pokey from crashing when run without sound, and he fixed some problems in helifire.

WIP:

- 0.80u2: Aaron fixed bug in 555 timer that led to whiny noise in Hit Me. Removed 'Game Speed (analog)' and 'Card Width (analog)' dipswitches.

- 17th March 2004: Aaron Giles - Derrick Renaud managed to figure out why Hit Me was whining, which is a relief because at 22kHz it sounded pretty annoying.

- 0.80u1: Aaron Giles added discrete sound support for Hit Me, fixed incorrect video (missing scanlines and inverting logic), added controls to handle card width and game/sound speed and cleaned up memory maps. Correct graphics resolution to 320x190 and added 'Game Speed (analog)' and 'Card Width (analog)' dipswitches.

-  9th March 2004: Aaron Giles - I've been talking to Derrick Renaud about the discrete sound system and how I can start getting involved. Derrick suggested to look at Ramtek's Hit Me, but it had some tricks all its own. I had to add a D-type flip-flop primitive. I think I've finally got it working now. While I had the schematics handy, I took some extra time to fix up some video and memory map issues in the driver.

- 0.74u2: Added clone Black Jack (Mirco).

- 27th September 2003: MASH added clone Black Jack (Micro).

- 0.60: Added 'Hit Me'.

- 18th April 2002: David Haywood updated the old Hit Me / Brick Yard drivers and added Barricade to it.

NOTE:

- When you get to the second level, you can't jump on to the rope the way you normally would in e.g. Pitfall. Don't move right, just press jump and you are on the rope! :) Same thing happens on the end of that screen, if you try to jump on the bell you end up on the rope again. This *IS* the correct behaviour, as odd it seems. Or rather, this is the behaviour of a real PCB. Stu


Bugs:

- Game crashes after the 4th or 5th level. *Update* If you get 5 BELLS (5 screen in a row without dying), and then die, the game resets. hunchbkd36b6red Ben Jos W./YMI

- Clone hunchbks: In Esmerela's tower, rope on left leaves a trace when moving upward. hunchbks36b9gre Hazard


Possible Bugs:

- If you turn while jumping, hunchback will be garbled: 1st part of hunchback gets flipped in frame 1, 2nd part of him gets flipped in frame 2. I doubt this happened in the original arcade. hunchbak056gre Jonemaan


DIP/Input Bugs:

- hunchbak, hunchonly: In hunchbak buttons don't work for player 2, and no directions are offered for the 2nd player either. Also, in hunchonly, there no directions offered for player 2. hunchbak056gra Karasu

We repressed the galactic system where high grade creature lived, and expanded his territory successively. However, it is 3030 now and we ruled over huge country. But, it became too large to do ot. The eye could not have reached at last in all parts of the heavenly bodies and rebellion arose here and there......and finally big revolt rose in a country named Regit. The rebel army extended their power rapidly, centering around their territory and made haste to build up a thorou ghly strengthened country. To control this, we headed on to Regit in "High Voltage".

0.36b1 [Aaron Giles]


DIP/Input Bugs:

- It appears that the controls are out of whack since at least .80 rendering the game near unplayable. (It was apparently broken in .79, so whatever fix was made still left some issues). Pretty much all pedal (button 1) functions seem to be messed up (ie. speed, select, continue etc). And I think some of the other button/direction keys are also. I know it works correctly in .73, so that can be used for comparison perhaps. hydra080u1gra Twisty

Samples required


Bugs:

- Clone spcewars: The tunes that play, for example when you get shot, are far too quiet - the volume needs to be increased. spcewars36rc2ora Fujix/The tECHNIDNA


DIP/Input Bugs:

- Jatre Specter (Set 1) gives the option < A > versus < B >: Apparently there is a reference to *another* input. bit7 of IN1. It uses that input to select A or B. Was this really a DIP setting or did players simply hold one of the left/right buttons down while pressing start or have a way to toggle that input? MAME currently defaults IN1 bit7=0, which means professional eg. game A , and there is a DIP setting to change it - but it just seems odd the player can't select it, when the screen tells the player to SELECT A OR B GAME. jspecter074gra dlfrance

Bugs:

- jumpbug lacks a lot of sound effects. (e.g. enemy explosion, sounds of taking money sacks and diamonds, erupt sound, various sounds inside the pyramid). *Update*: more info. jumpbug36rc1gre Fujix

- About jumpbug starfield again. Blinking frequency is still wrong in 37b1. It is as same as Galaga, the reporter says. jumpbug37b1gre Fujix


WIP:

- 15th March 2000: Zsolt Vasvari fixed the star field in Jump Bug.

- 0.35b9: Added clone Jump Bug (bootleg). Correct cpu1 rom ($a000) lenght to 2kb.

- 26th March 1999: Zsolt Vasvari merged Jump Bug with Galaxian and emulated the protection.

- 0.26: Nicola fixed Jump Bug driver which is now perfect. Colors are still wrong without proms.

- 0.18: Fixed bugs in Jump Bug and Bagman sound drivers which caused page faults when run under DOS.

- 0.16: Richard Davies and Brad Oliver provided drivers for the so-called "Sega" version of Jump Bug (it's actually a bootleg with the protection checks removed). The driver supports sound.

- 0.12: Preliminary support for Jump Bug. It uses a modified Scramble driver, the hardware seems to be similar. It's not playable (the input bits are not even mapped), and resets after a few seconds. Nicola was not particularly interested in this game, so anyone volunteers to complete the driver?


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- Control car by rhythmically bouncing it with joystick.

- Score points and rewards by jumping on money bag, diamonds or cloud.

- Score points by shooting enemies (Extra points for shooting joker).

- The clone Pirate Pete is totally different to Jungle King.

Bugs:

- When playing 2 players, then both game is over, the screen FLIP (quickly) and displays "Game Over" right after it says "Player 2 Game over". Its like acting that it is in cocktail mode but only when the game is over. Tested on 37b16 thru 055. Junglek055gre Thenasty

- Clone piratpet: It seems impossible to rescue the girl. I have jumped on her dozens of times and the player dies on contact. Also on this stage, every other man you get automatically dies when the screen first displays. Does this game have protection in it that's different from Jungle King? Bad dump? Note: I used the Free Play dip switch to get there, but the player auto-dies like that in attract mode as well. piratpet060yel Smitdogg / The tECHIDNA


WIP:

- 0.60: Added clone Pirate Pete.

- 25th January 2002: MASH provided information on how to add Pirate Pete to the Jungle King driver.

- 0.37b15: Added clone Jungle Hunt (Brazil).

- 12th April 2001: Zsolt Vasvari resubmitted the addition of Jungle Hunt Brazil version.

- 25th February 2001: Filipe Estima added a Brasilian Jungle Hunt ROM set.

- 0.36b14: Zsolt Vasvari added a newer version of Jungle King.

- 22nd December 1999: Zsolt Vasvari added another Jungle King romset.

- 0.31: Nicola Salmoria fixed missing/bad sound effects in Jungle King.

- 0.29: Nicola Salmoria added digital audio in the Taito games (used for some sound effects, most notably Tarzan's yell in Jungle King). Also, music plays in Jungle King. Nicola also emulates the hardware of the Taito games (Elevator Action, Jungle King, Wild Western, Front Line) more faithfully. Playfield priority is accurate in Jungle King, however this broke Wild Western - strange. Front Line works. Merged all the drivers into taito.c

- 0.27: Elevator Action, Jungle King and Wild Western now use the same video hardware driver (taito.c)

- 0.25: Nicola did some fixes to Taito Games (Jungle King and Elevator Action) about background placement and coins per credit dipswitch. Plus vertical scroll support in Jungle King (used in ground shake), correct sprite priority, and no more rubbish is present during change of stage.

- 0.22: Added preliminary sound support to Elevator Action and Jungle King. Tarzan yell scream sample missing.

- 0.21.5: Nicola fixed colors in Jungle King (I have some screenshots and colors doesn't match. BTW these are much better than previous). Finally Jungle King doesn't need to select the graphic bank, but still have some glitches on sprites.

- 0.18: Preliminary support for Jungle King / Jungle Hunt. Slow but playable. Nicola haven't the gfx bank selector, therefore you'll have to pick the correct background graphics yourself. Use keys C and V to change it.

0.63 [Aaron Giles, Bryan McPhail]


HardDisk required


NOTE:

- This can be quite hard to tell, but if the player on the right side of the screen wanders close to the edge, that characters gfx will "loop" over to the other side of the screen. In this image, that small blue single pixel line to the very left is Fulgore's claw "looping". I have verified and this happens on a real PCB as well. Shadichu

- It seems that part of Jago's stage background is missing. On the right side of the stage we can see a "lake" with sun light being reflected over it but where the sunlight come from? That's the bug, there's only a black background when it should be a image of a sun and some black birds flying around.snapshot Not a bug, it was like that in the arcade version. They changed it later, for whatever reason, for the SNES version. NeoGouki


Bugs:

- The color of the text is wrong during the game ending. Since it isn't documented anywhere else, I should probably mention that there are incorrect squigley lines on some gfx in kinst2, eg. the water in Spinal's stage and the red sky in another. Update in .73: The colors in kinst ending have been fixed. Problems in kinst2 still remain. kinst067gre Karasu / dcorban / Smitdogg / Shadichu

- The particular level shown in this shot has scrolling issues. Might it be that the BG gfx is offset too much to the left (see right side of the image)? Also, look in the upper left corner for some gfx garbage. kinst063gre NeoGouki


WIP:

- 0.81u4: Added Killer Instinct (v1.5d) and clone (v1.3). The old version is now clone (v1.4). Aaron Giles cleaned up memory maps, found second bitmap page, fixing a bunch of video problems and romoving the egregious hack, fixed sound reset and initialization, all diagnostics pass, fixed coinage dipswitches and added 2 alternate ROM sets for each game. This fixes two reported bugs. Also fixed the MIPS 3/4 x86 dynamic recompiler. This fixed another crash bug.

Possible Bugs:

- I'm 90% sure it's a real bug in game, but I'll look into it some more. Coin B free play dip has no effect.

0.33b3 [Aaron Giles]


Possible Bugs:

- Sound in attract mode doesn't work, with or without the option enabled in service mode. Update: Well, it does, kinda. After the game cycles through the demonstration mode about 16 times, you will get attract sound. This only lasts for one quick demonstration klax round, and then the game falls silent again for another 16 or so rounds. The best way to see this is to frameskip 11, and unthrottle (f10) the game for a few mins - otherwise it would take an age. I doubt this is a bug unless someone has proof to the contrary - some other Atari games seem to take a long while to play attract sound too. klax056gre monstertooth / mach


WIP:

- 0.53: Added clone Klax (prototype set 1) and (prototype set 2).

Bugs:

Possible Bugs:

- If I'd been thinking, I would have recorded on the Japanese romset, which shows the score at all times. But anyway, here's the breakdown: After the first fight with the bo-girl, my score is 44100. After the second fight, which is a perfect time-out, the game not only glitches by saying that I have scored 30,0000 pts and not adding them to my total, it has me at a total of 0 points. In the next fight, against C. Vincent or whatever, my score is back to normal. I finish the round with 49600 points total and time and vitality bonuses earn me points bringing my total up to 55200. So, essentially, while the game says I score 30,000 pts for the perfect against bo-girl, in reality I score nothing (see inp file). knckhead071u2gre2 QTQuazar

NOTE:

- If you have Mai on your team, and stand still with her, your opponent will stand still too. Some opponents 'understand' it though, and will attack even if Mai stands still eg. kof2001 last boss. This is correct behavior. The CPU would NOT move until Mai makes a move. I tested it on my real MVS. Karasu

Neo-Geo


NOTE:

- It still has too fast auto animation in the backgrounds. Examples: Terry/Andy/Joe team background (the harbor): people are moving way too fast: guy bopping his head, girl swinging her arm and someone moving legs. King/Mai/Yuri team background(the jazz bar): the jazz playing looks more as if there's a hardrock/speedmetal group playing ;) I ran MAME side by side with the with KOF 95 cart, the background is NOT moving too fast. It's perfect. Although it looks stupid, its fine. Not a bug. Same goes for Last Blade. Karasu


Bugs:

- The sample played when Kyo performs his desperation move (D, Db, B, Db, D, Df, F + C when power is maxed out) is garbled/bad. Sounds much like the garbled sound in the intro of Savage Reign. .53 did NOT have this problem ('cause I just checked with my own old build...). Update: In kof2000 and kof2000n, doing Seth's QCF,QCF+C special against a blocking opponent makes the hits sound all scratchy. kof95055gre ddragonukb / NeoGouki / elgondolero

Bugs:

- Music PCM in "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle (prototype)" is missing (didn't happen in beta 12, and doesn't happen with NeoRAGEx). Update: It affects ALL versions of KOF99, encrypted or not, still in 0.56; ElSemi's Jukebox (same as Nebula's engine I believe) sounds correct. Here is an mp3 of the intro music (sounding correct). It's 155 kB in size. kof99p37b14yel Takuma Sakazaki

- Clone kof99p: Scratchy sound bug, varies from computer to computer, here are two results: Computer #1: After a lengthy playing session just noticed that while all the sound is in place, the samples are not coming out right. To find this bug play a versus game and when the match is over get the opponent to challenge you again. At this point in the versus select screen. After about 10 seconds you get scratchy sound. Computer #2: Sound seems to be ok once you get back into the actual game. For me, though, the samples are fine, but the music has skipping and hanging until you get into the fight. kof99p058gre ddragonukb / Karasu


Possible Bugs:

- I think there's another (possible) bug regarding "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" (kof99) and its clone "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle (prototype)" (kof99p). I don't know if the "heat wave" effect is done with the NeoGeo raster effects, but... disabling raster effects (pressing F1) has no effect in the game display, even though it shows messages "Raster effects disabled" and "Raster effects enabled". I think there might be two possible causes: 1 - MAME is not disabling raster effects when F1 is pressed and 2 - kof99 and kof99p don't need raster effects. kof9937b12gre Takuma Sakazaki


WIP:

- 0.71u2: Swap kof99 with kof99a.

Bugs:

- Clone kovplus: List of protection related bugs in this game. If you know any more, let us know on the message board. You can't pick up the fire sword after 10 times in the second mission with the character "ZhuGeLiang". Reproduction notes: 1)At the place where there are several miasma and ensure there are more than two players (ZHUGE must be included), ZHUGE hits the case lies top right corner of the screen. Then he says "Look out! Maybe there are secret rooms around this area." go into the room from the top right corner (see snapshot 1). 2)Here you will see three weapons: A fire sword on the left side (can be only used by ZHUGE and MA); A fire arrow on the right side (can be only used by HUANG); A SHENG HUO LING on the middle (see snapshot 2a snapshot 2b). 3)To pick up the fire sword, ZHUGE must put on coverup frist (see snapshot 3a snapshot 3b). 4)The fire sword won't be in your hand till you pick it up 10 times (on the arcade machine). But here you'll never pick it up. Also you'll never go outside (see snapshot, inp file and save state). kovplus065gre xll

Bugs:

- On the bottom corner(s) on some sprites, there are tiny visual artifacts. For example, on the bottom left near player 1's heicopter, there is a tiny blue ''dash'' flickering until player 1's copter blows up. Same thing with the red waterplane in the canal in stage 1, there are two artifacts at the same position near the waterplane, the first, a blue ''dash'', is right below the water trail sprite from the waterplane, the second, a black ''dash'' is below the shadow from the waterplane, both artifacts flicker. ktiger2061gre Nerox91

- kungfum, kungfud, kungfub, kungfub2 and spartanx: There are problems when you're trying to jump in diagonals. For example, you're walking then you jump (up button) then game should jump on diagonal. But for some reason the game jumps straight up. This is not a bug. The arcade game behaves this way. You have to be walking horizontally for about a second before you can leap diagonally. Stroff


WIP:

- 0.37b6: Correct Z80 CPU1 clock speed to 3072000 and audio M6803 CPU2 and the 2x AY-8910 to 894886 Hz.

- 0.36b10: Added clone Spartan X (Japan).

- 25th June 1999: Zsolt Vasvari fixed Kung Fu Master sprite priorities at the end of a level.

- 0.35b11: Add prom ($620 - video timing, same as battroad).

- 0.35b7: Correct graphics resolution to 256x256 and monitor/video frequency to 55Hz.

- 0.34b7: Nicola Salmoria add 2 new Kung Fu Master sets.

- 0.29: Aaron Giles improved sound in Kung Fu Master.

- 0.26: Mauro Minenna introduced a new option (-dir4) that simplify the use of the joysticks to be connected on the keyboard. This modify resolves the problem of diagonal direction in games such as PacMan, Popeye, and Kung Fu Master.

- 0.24: Nicola fixed definitively Kung Fu Master driver which has now 100% perfect colors and sprite positioning. Thanks to Paul Swan for color scheme. Original version (copyright Irem) is now supposed to be in 'kungfum' directory, while the bootleg (O.K.) is supposed to be in 'kungfub'. Test mode doesn't work for bootleg version (as is right to be). Hi Score Support in each version as well. Mirko Buffoni finally fixed problems with ADPCM decoding, so now Kung Fu Master doesn't need separate samples anymore (he didn't distribute them because of copyright on sounds). The samples are now calculated during bootstrap of the game.

- 0.23: Mirko Buffoni added Kung Fu Master driver to MAME. Credits fly to Ishmair for the hardware information and to Nicola for fixing sprite bugs.


STORY:

- A Kung-Fu master, Thomas and Silvia were suddenly attacked by several unknown guys. Silvia was kidnapped by them.

- There is evidence that this is a Japanese version, not World version. There are some kanji and kakatana in-game(example:versus first boss). kurikint37b15ora Kale

- Clone kurikina: This one is for sure a prototype, check these things compared with other sets: * DIPSWs invincibility and slow motion (known issue) * The green carpet in level 2 isn't animated, and doesn't do anything. * No water in level 2/3, only brown garbage instead ,also doesn't do anything too (It should hurt in level 2 and slowdown movements in level 3). * Difficulty very unoptimized : I've encountered FOUR black ninjas in level 3 without doing leeching, and the enemy rate it's excessive for a game that you have to stay still for long periods ... * No end credits. Pretty strange that a manufacturer like Taito sells a game that doesn't give any credit at the end (the other sets obviously gives it). * And some other minor things (graphic glitches vs. bosses, bad-oriented continue screen, etc) ... kurikina055ora Kale

0.01 [Nicola Salmoria]


NOTE:

- Pac-Man (Midway), Ms Pac Man (bootleg), Crush Roller, Pengo and Lady Bug are the first supported games in MAME.


Bugs:

- When you play a two player game, both players have to alternate using the P1 joystick. This is the correct behavior as the original machine only had one stick. However, when your game is over and it's time for player two to enter their name for a high score, they cannot use the P1 joystick. They have to use the P2 joystick. ladybug080u1gre krick


WIP:

- 0.73: Added clone Ladybug (bootleg on Galaxian hardware) - Input ports incomplete.

- 28th August 2003: Mike Coates added a version of Lady Bug running on Galaxian hardware and Video Pool to the Galaxian driver.

- 0.18: Nicola added some lousy, very inaccurate, noise to the 76496 emulator. This affects Lady Bug, Green Beret, Galaxian, Pisces, Moon Cresta, Moon Quasar.

Bugs:

- The music occasionally cuts off during play. Plus, when the music does play, it usually plays really really slow. These problems (usually) start occuring after the second or third round. The music does resume back to normal after you win the round but the problem starts again when the next round begins. There were no music problems like this previously. logicpro072gre kiyo21

0.36b7 [Nao]


Bugs:

- Some enemies' patterns are wrong. Check the first boss for example: on an original PCB, it should come near you and seek your position, but in MAME version he turns at the right regardless of your position. This is regardless of the DIPSW difficulty. loht060gre Kale

- At level 6, there are some floating skull wizards that shoot 8-way yellow bullets. Verifying with the real PCB I have noticed that in MAME these bullets are faster (about 0.2-0.3 secs to go out of the screen, the real thing about 0.5 secs). loht061gre Kale

0.37b12 [Phil Stroffolino]


Bugs:

- I've been playing Looping with my PSX pad via USB as usual. Most games in Mame 0.37 b12 (K6 opt) seem to be working well. However, Looping in my experience tends to reset randomly, as though someone had pressed F3. Usually this happens after I destroy the Terminal. The reset happens less frequently if I play via keyboard. Update: Unfortunately, Sky Bumper (skybump, driver looping.c) seems to experience the same reset bug that affects Looping. This happens randomly and usually after I complete at least 5 frames. Another update: It seems that the reset bug in looping is caused by pressing the fire button near the beginning of the first level. It seems to occur much more frequently on my last life, too, and destroying the Terminal doesn't affect the bug's frequency. I still have yet to test Sky Bumper... loopingc37b12yel Mojo2000 / Sixtoe / The tECHIDNA / Kurushimi

- Some voice samples are either cut short or don't play at all (with some weird static or beep replacing them). looping37b14gre Kurushimi


WIP:

- 0.37b14: Replace TMS9995 with TMS9995 (3MHz), TMS9980A/TMS9981 (2MHz), AY-8910 (2MHz), TMS5220 (640000 Hz) and DAC sound. Correct cpu2 rom ($0) lenght to 2kb and change cpu2 roms addresses from ($2000, $1000) to ($800, $2800).

- 27th March 2001: Mathis Rosenhauer adjusted the CPU speeds in Looping.

- 24th March 2001: Mathis Rosenhauer added fire and balloon sounds to Looping, so there should be no more missing sounds.

- 20th March 2001: Mathis Rosenhauer added preliminary sound to Looping, but some sound effects are still missing.

- 0.37b12: Added Looping (set 1) and clone (set 2).

- 29th January 2001: Phil Stroffolino sent in the playable Looping driver, with correct graphics and colors, but it lacks one of the nicest features of the game - speech and music. The COP420 microcontroller in fact helps with the CPU communication, so it is probably necessary for sound emulation.

- 28th January 2001: Phil Stroffolino made a big step forward with the Looping driver. While the game is definitely not playable yet (due to the unemulated COP420 microprocessor), at least the title screen shows up.

-  1st November 2000: Phil Stroffolino started on a Looping driver, it runs I/O CPU code fine now but main CPU code does not seem to be valid and the microcontroller isn't emulated, so nothing works.


Statement:

- Looping used perhaps the most bizarre assortment of hardware ever deployed in an arcade game. The schematics run to at least seven pages and no one really wants to hurt their heads that badly - Randy Hoffman.

- 0.12: Added support for Lost Tomb (Stern game running on Super Cobra hardware), but it doesn't work well (crashes during the demo, and it's not playable) and the graphics are garbled. Nicola think some of the ROMs might be corrupted.


Possible Bugs:

- losttomb, losttmbh: One frame of your hero-sprite gets garbled when using a whip (a small box appears instead of your sprite). That happens in both losttomb & losttmbh. I dont know if that happens on the real hw. losttomb058gre startrash

- 0.36RC1: This game was removed from MAME. Nicola wrote: Note that a "gambling machine" is different from a "video game with a gambling theme". The discrimination is strictly a technical one, not a moral one (a gambling machine gives back money/tokens/tickets, a video game does not).

0.79u2 [Norbert Kehrer]


NOTE:

- The game is kind of a combination of a shooter and a driving game. You drive a car equipped with a gun on a road. The landscape around you shows different settings (cities, country side, tunnels) and scrolls by from the top to the bottom of the screen. Your enimies (mad aliens) drive in front of you in a galaxian-like formation and you have to shoot them. Watch out for mad aliens leaving the group and turning back to attack your car. Sometimes the road narrows which makes it difficult to dodge the mad aliens. Later in the game obstacle cars appear. They try to ram you, and you can destroy them by shooting their tires. From time to time you enter a tunnel. There it gets dark and you cannot see the attacking enemies until they come within range of your headlight. The Mad Alien machine had kind of a mini cabinet, which was rather uncommon for an arcade game. After the release of the dedicated Mad Alien machine, DECO made also a version of Mad Alien for their Cassette System.

- As with Super Tank (Norbert Kehrer's first driver for MAME), it was very hard to find out how things work. On the one hand, this time the reverse-engineering process was easier, because I had schematics for the game, and it uses two 6502 processors. On the other hand, the video hardware of Mad Alien is rather strange and much more complicated than in Super Tank. So it took quite a lot longer to make this driver. And I am still not 100% sure if the colors are emulated correctly. I would be very interested in comments from owners of a Mad Alien machine and from people who remember the gameplay and the colors of the game. In my MAME driver the colors appear different from the colors in the game flyer for Mad Alien. One difference is e.g., that the walls in the tunnel are red in my driver, whereas in the flyer they are yellow. Another difference is the shape of the headlight. There is definitely a different shape in the Mad Alien ROMs I have (the shape is "rounder"). The headlight shape on the pictures of the arcade flyer must be from an earlier ROM version or maybe from the version for the DECO Cassette System. Additionally, in the flyer picture all the enemies are visible in the tunnel, but I am rather sure from the schematics, that they are only visible, when they are within range of the headlight (this is also what the game manual says). Can someone confirm these differences between the flyer and the actual game? Are the colors in my MAME driver correct (see screen shots)? Brian Deuel: The colors look similar to how he remembers them in the eighties.

WIP:

-  4th December 2003: Barry Rodewald - Getting there... The sprite to playfield collision detection still needs to be figured out. And I think the playfield is a little bit more colourful too.

-  1st December 2003: Barry Rodewald - Now it can run the game. But there is no playfield. Don't know, as yet, how or where it reads level data and displays the playfield.

- 28th November 2003: Barry Rodewald - Got Malzak running a bit - still some graphics unimplemented, but this is enough to get a few inputs mapped too. It would seem that there may be some form of ROM banking going on. Background colours are disabled for now, as I'm pretty sure that it was causing incorrect displays.

0.31 [Brad Oliver]


Bugs:

- Garbage on top of title screen after inserting coin. Overlay on marquee text on title screen seems corrupt. maniach37b11gre Labrat / Sixtoe

- All games: This bug is probably dues to the inaccurate emulation of the 6705MCU(?) When playing the game, if you go to the left or right ends of the ring the playfield graphic of the ring will flip to the other side, making it look as if you are out of the ring when you are not. Update: This is triggered by 'inserting a coin' and connects to the reports of garbage in maniach37b11gre which I made in a past life ;) matmaniac37b14gre Trojan / El Condor

- Clone maniach2: Additionally, If you insert a credit in maniach and press reset, the game doesn't restart anymore - you must exit MAME. maniach236b10gre Bugfinder


WIP:

- 0.36RC1: Correct audio M6809 CPU2 clock speed to 1.5MHz.

- 0.59: Rename (mappyjp) to (mappyj).

- 28th June 1999: Manuel Abadia fixed the custom IO chip reset bugs in the Mappy driver.

- 0.29: Aaron Giles made some Video drawing optimization to Mappy, plus test mode now works both in Mappy and Dig Dug 2.

- 0.27: Aaron Giles did a major rewrite of his Super Pac man and Mappy drivers: - support for Dig Dug 2 and Pac & Pal - High score save in all games - 100% colors and sound samples (in Super Pac man the siren clicks a bit, but neither I nor jrok can figure it out; the sample data *is* correct) - better sound playback frequency (was missing some high bits!) - arcade accurate frequency calculation (thanks to jrok!) - removed all palette hacks; everything is clean - added loop optimizations for speed - video now properly displayed, including high priority characters

- 0.26a: Super Pac Man and Mappy have correct pitch now (thanks Aaron and Satoh).

- 0.26: Added support for Mappy. Aaron Giles also added sound support and very close arcade colors.

GAMEPLAY:

- A static underwater scence with obstacles in it, like seaweed, crabs and other stuff. You have a limited number of "strokes" per screen as well as a timer to work against. Your goal is to *bounce* yourself around the screen using *Strokes* on the trackball to try to reach a *female* octopus before your run out of strokes or time.  You sort of bounce yourself around the screen like a billiard ball would bounce, but once in a while bubbles and other stuff will come up from underneath you and carry you away from where you are trying to get.  When you reach your goal you get another more difficult screen, etc.

0.12 [Ivan Mackintosh]


Possible Bugs:

- Implementing cocktail flipping in this game is probably harder than I think (mapping the pin to the right address in memory), but the way this is done on a genuine board is explained here: http://www.brasington.org/arcade/cm/trouble.shtml - "Centipede and Millipede do not have a cocktail DIP switch like some games do. Instead, Atari used a pin on the harness to determine upright versus cocktail mode. For millipede, this is pin 16. Millipede pin 16 should be left open (high) for upright, or grounded (low) for cocktail. This is backwards from how centipede does it." These instructions don't say on which IC this is done, but maybe someone who is familiar with the board or has a schematic would know which one (see manual and schematics). milliped066ora JetBlack

Possible Bugs:

- The non-emulated version plays 1 of 2 available screams, when performing a fatality on your opponent. This is regardless of whether you are using input (player) 1 or 2. The emulated version plays only scream 1, every time, when using input (player) 1. If using input (player) 2, it plays scream 2. Lui Kang and Sonya's screams should not be an issue, as they're completely different than the two I'm refering to. Considering the MK series' history of playing different screams depending on your input (player) choice, some would assume that I'm simply recalling the game incorrectly. I truly believe I'm not. mk063gre JMSzczap82

- There are some glitches on the test your might bonus screen and on the attract mode, it happens almost every time that I play and more often on the second test your might screen (lines aren't supposed to be there). The bug on the attract mode happens when you lose a fight and don't continue, then leave the attract mode running, there will be missing the letters of high scores and in the profile of the fighters (see snapshots). mk062gre WilliamBR / Bugfinder / Thenasty / Reznor007

- mk (and clone mkr4): Low punch and low kick Diagnostic/Switch Tests for both players result in sound but no graphic indication (no filled-in circle). Note: clones mkla1, mkla2, mkla3, and mkla4 (driver: midyunit.c) properly indicate button activation. I don't know how this compares to actual machines. mk056gre wyrdbug / TriggerFin

0.34b7 [Alex Pasadyn, Zsolt Vasvari, Kurt Mahan]


NOTE:

- If you let attract mode run through 3 complete times. there will be no sound on the 4th and after. Many games do not play attract mode sound after the 1st few cycles, try hitting a button like start or up, the sound comes back. TheDarkAbyss

- In the battle plan screen, the bottom 1/16th of the furthest background layer is missing (see snapshot). I was bored at work today, so I started messing with our MK2 machine. I cranked up the contrast and brightness until things were starting to smear, and then checked the fighter ladder screen. MAME is indeed accurate. Reznor007

- mk2 and clones: When you insert a coin a sound is played. In Mortal Kombat 2, the sound is a voice that says EXCELLENT, but when you insert a coin during the attract mode the sound doesn't play. It only fails when you insert a coin during the attract mode, but it works when a coin is inserted when you are at the character select screen or playing. OK, tested on the real PCB. This is correct behaviour. If you insert during attract mode, there is no sound, but if you insert during play/character select, there is a sound. Reznor007


Possible Bugs:

- mk: The vertical resolution of these games - at least in the service mode - may be wrong. Enter service mode and enter the various menus. mk, mk2, mk3: game adjustments/standard pricing. umk3: main menu. I guess these sizes were chosen because otherwise garbage would be displayed in-game? mk237b5gre IF

- mk2: Occasionally when watching attract mode, the music speeds up and plays at a very fast tempo. This bug is volatile and hard to reproduce though. Choose Melina, beat your first opponent. Then go on to fight your next opponent; lose and don't continue, then watch attract mode. mk2137b5gre Jeff B

0.37b5 [Aaron Giles]


NOTE:

- mk3 (and clones): When in the test menu, if you enter the hardware info section you will not be able to exit (on bottom of screen it says press any button to exit but you cannot.) MAME still runs but can't escape screen. This bug happens most on the umk3 clones (I'll occaisonally be able to exit the screen on the mk3 clones). This occurs on the pcb also and has caused me to have to reset it many times to play the game again (UMK3). This is NOT a mame bug, it is a bug in the game itself. TheDarkAbyss

- mk3 and umk3: If Kabal is sweeped (hold back, press low kick), and that sweep is the last attack; meaning you KO Kabal with a sweep, he lies down in the wrong frame. If you sweep him without winning, he lies down normally. This happens in MK3 *and* in UMK3 so i don't think it's a bug in the real game. AFAIK this does not happen to other characters. I remember this happening in the arcade. It seemed odd, but MAME does it right. Karasu

- umk3: umk3 In the cave level of umk3, there's a few tiles missing in the background. Notice the black area in the middle in the screenshot (see snapshot). Not a bug, here is a screen capture from a real PCB. Reznor007

- umk3: On Reptile's profile screen, he looks like he has a "hole" in his hand. Not a bug, here is a screen capture from a real PCB. Reznor007

- umk3: On Kitana's profile screen, she has a black line under her eye. Not a bug, here is a screen capture from a real PCB. Reznor007

- umk3: Some backgrounds have problems when the screen fades, and when the continue screen appears. The lowest background layer will fade too late compared with the rest of the screen, and when the continue screen appears the lowest background layer will just disappear. This happens in at least the following stages: graveyard(mk3), waterfront(umk3), desert(umk3). Not a bug, here is a screen capture from a real PCB. Reznor007


Bugs:

- Clone umk3: Sometimes reseting the maching during a game yields wrong colors on the difficulty selection screen. Seems to be a bankswitching problem. It also happens if you let the attract mode, run for a long time and start the game. umk3137b5gre MC68K/IF V

- umk3: Sometimes resetting the maching during a game yields wrong colors on the difficulty selection screen. Seems to be a bankswitching problem. It also happens if you let the attract mode, run for a long time and start the game. umk3137b5gre MC68K/IF

- umk3: When playing Scorpion, and you use the little line or wire or rope thingy (if on the left, it's left, left, lshift), he should say 'Get over here!' MAME cuts it off, saying only 'Get ov...'. Update: This bug only existed in the arcade in revision 1.0 of UMK3. The later 1.1 and 1.2 revisions did not have this bug. In MAME the two later versions DO have this bug, which is not correct. umk3237b5gre MC68K / beegboss

- umk3: Once you unlock the three hidden characters (Mileena, Ermac, and Classic Sub-Zero), whenever you return to the character selection screen (about 99% of the time, and you may need to restart the game at least once first) the colors and background will be totally messed up. It is very similar to the known bug umk3137b5gre in midwolfu.c, except that now it happens on the character selection screen as well as the difficulty screen (see snapshot / nvram file). umk3059gre Alyas


Possible Bugs:

- umk3, mk3: In the 'church' background, the shadows disappear behind the 2nd background layer. This is noticeable when you jump (see snapshot). umk3060gre_2 Jonemaan


WIP:

- 0.74: Correct ADSP2105 clock speed to 10MHz.

- 15th September 2003: Justin Dawkins submitted a modification to the input ports in MK, MK2, MK3, UMK3 and wwfmania.

- 0.63: Correct graphics resolution to 400x254.

-  4th May 2002: Aaron Giles fixed the level select screens in (Ultimate) Mortal Kombat 3.

- 31st March 2002: Aaron Giles fixed the shadows in Mortal Kombat 2 and 3.

- 0.37b5: Added Mortal Kombat 3 (rev 2.1) and clones (rev 1.0), (rev 2.0), Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (rev 1.2) and (rev 1.1).

- 27th July 2000: Aaron Giles and Ernesto Corvi submitted the Williams Wolf Unit driver, which supports the following games perfectly with full sound: Mortal Kombat 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, NBA Maximum Hangtime, 2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge, Rampage: World Tour and WWF Wrestlemania.

0.77u3 [Luca Elia]

0.74u2 [?]


Possible Bugs:

- Driver automatically grabs correct time from MAME but year is set to 1904 instead of 2004 (see snapshot 1). It's not a bug from this game because as you can see on the second screenshot, the game is "year 2000" compliant. When you push the "clock set" button (3) on the clock setting service screen (see 2nd screenshot), the game freezes. All you can do then is reset or quit the game. So it's impossible to set the clock since changes aren't saved. Suggestion: Not really a bug as it shouldn't freeze, but you shouldn't be able to save the clock either. We aren't going to update your system clock... Actually, this could be better. In all of the other systems the clock is seeded from the system clock and then updated in memory. This one simply reads the current time from the system clock on every read with localtime(), for example (see snapshots). mmpanic078u3ora Nomax / PsikyoFan

NOTE:

- Momoko is at the lower base of an escalator. Normally, when you press up while standing on the illuminated square, you go up the escalator. Occasionally, when you press up (usually when running and shooting), even if you're at the base of the escalator (at its lower level), you go DOWN an "invisible" escalator! This really sucks if you're on the floor right above the flames, since it means instant death. From the source file, momoko.c: Real machine has some bugs.(escalator bug, sprite garbage) It is not emulation bug. Uki


WIP:

- 18th March 2001: Uki added screen flip and fixed some dip switch settings in Momoko 120%.

- 16th March 2001: Marco Cassili fixed dip switch settings in Momoko 120%.

0.05 [Nicola Salmoria]


NOTE:

- Clone smooncrs: This set (unlike the other eight clones) does not make use of the keys for player 2. Not a bug, the game ALWAYS checks the inputs from player 1 (even in "cocktail" mode) due to game Z80 code at 0x2b1c and 0x3306. stephh


Bugs:

- Side-byside test... This seems fine apart from the stars. Here are the observations. mooncrst37b8ora Gary Walton

- Clone mooncrsb: 3 mooncresta bootlegs (mooncrgx, mooncrsb, mooncrs2): Since 36b16, demo sequence is way out in left. In older versions, when no.1 with no.2 fighter tries to dock no.3, 1+2 crashes on no.3. And this is correct arcade work. After 36b16, 1+2 doesn't crash on no.3 and wonders at the bottom of the screen. This is the same behaviour as SPARCADE and Galemu which use 256x256 resolution not 254x224. So I guess the resolution for these games might have changed to 256x256 in MAME. btw MAME's game info says the resolution is 256x224. mooncrsb055gre Fujix

- Clone smooncrs: In cocktail mode you cant see player 2's shots and enemies bullets go in other direction then your ship but they seem to hit you anyway. smooncrs37b16yel Gmitra

- Clone smooncrs: From when you start the emulation to when you lose your 1st life, a strange insectoid rumbling noise is heard, does not occur in any of the other clones. smooncrs061gre Fever

- 0.25: Robert Anschuetz provided infos about how to enable a shot sample with moonquasar, mooncresta, galaxian and clones. Found the meaning of SW1 in Moon Cresta (Thanks to Mikiya Yadohisa).

- 0.19: Changed noise_lenght and noise_rate values in Moon Cresta audio driver, so now noise is much more noisier!

- 0.18: Nicola added some lousy, very inaccurate, noise to the 76496 emulator. This affects Lady Bug, Green Beret, Galaxian, Pisces, Moon Cresta, Moon Quasar.

- 0.09: Support for the original Moon Cresta (Nichibutsu copyright). These ROMs are encrypted, and slightly different from the other version. This is very likely the version Chuck Cochems remembers (with aliens teleporting right in front of your ship). I renamed the other version (which looks like a mix of the code from a bootleg version and the graphics from the Gremlin original version) "mooncrsb".

- 0.05: Support for Moon Cresta (wrong colors, limited sound).

< Japan >


Bugs:

- Enemy cats don't speak at all. On a real PCB, they have a voice particular to each. This bug was discovered in .58. Update: The pitch of Mike's voice is too low, and the music isn't as high in the real arcade. Update: Attached is an mp3 of a Mouja pcb running. I think the pitch of the voice and sounds should be about 1.3 times higher and the music should be 0.9 of what it is on MAME, (maybe twice as fast). Where the voices of the opponents should be, there are sounds instead like drums or bleeps. Mike the main character's voice is too low pitched. The second attached mp3 is of the sounds I extracted from 11.bin in the Mouja rom. It's got the drums and other effects first, then Mike's phrases, some sounds, a couple of phrases from Mike, four sounds from each opponent (Madam - stage 7, Iincho - stage 8, Mimiko - stage 1, Tamayo - stage 5, Neko-Ittetsu - stage 3, Mamami - stage 4, Ogii - stage 2, Kuronosuke - stage 6, Bucchi - stage 9, then music which plays at the stupid flashing red screen with words, then an awful buzzing sound (must be data). This should be able to help in some way (hear a mp3 of the real pcb and mp3 of the extracted sounds from the ROM). mouja059yel Fujix / Yuuki-chan / Matiu


WIP:

-  1st March 2003: Big Lenny submitted a small fix to the DIP switches in Mouja.

-  2nd April 2001: Nicola Salmoria improved performance in Mouja.

TEST MODE:

WIP:

- 0.78u3: Aaron Giles fixed Moon Patrol crash.

-  5th January 2004: CCoder submitted fixes to the Psychic 5 and Moon Patrol drivers.

- 0.78u1: Stefan Jokisch added the new PROM dump for the Williams set, changed the size of the PROM dump for the IREM set, renamed all ROMs, converted the driver to the tilemap system, simplified background drawing by creating a 256x64 gfx layout and minor fixes to the video section based on schems. Correct palettesize from 192 to 576 colors.

-  3rd January 2004: Brian A. Troha fixed one ROM in Moon Patrol.

-  1st January 2003: Stefan Jokisch added PROMs and converted Moon Patrol to the tilemap system.

- 0.37b6: Correct audio M6803 CPU2 and the 2x AY-8910 clock speed to 894886 Hz.

- 0.34RC1: Nicola fixed music in Moon Patrol, Traverse USA and the other Irem games.

- 0.29: Accurate colors in Moon Patrol. Aaron Giles improved sound and Valerio Verrando support HIGH SCORE in Moon Patrol.

- 0.15: Fixed most of the graphics problems with Moon Patrol. The video driver is a gigantic kludge right now, but it works and at a reasonable speed (though I can't reach 60fps on my 486/100).

- 0.13: Began working on Moon Patrol's background. It's quite messed up now.

- 0.12: Support for Moon Ranger (bootleg version of Moon Patrol).

WIP:

- 0.28: Fabrice Frances added *emulated* sound to Q*Bert, Reactor, Krull and Mad Planets. The samples are no longer needed and may be removed. Q*Bert Qubes would work as well, if we had the sound ROM ;-( Speech is not emulated... yet!

- 0.23: Full rotation allowed in Mad Planets (Thanks to Andrew Scott).

- 0.21: Mad Planets doesn't crash anymore with the new samples (shorter!)

- 0.17: Fabrice Frances submitted a massive contribution: an 8086 CPU emulator, and drivers for Q*Bert and Mad Planets. They run quite slowly on Nicola's 486/100 (~25 fps) but are playable. Q*Bert has sound too (with samples).

TEST MODE:

NOTE:

- Clone Mr. Du! (mrdu): In this bootleg, diamonds give an absurd number of credits (99? 256? The game only displays 9; I gave up counting). However, diamonds appear very seldomly when compared to the parent, regardless of dip switch setting. I can confirm from experience that this is the proper behavior for this ROM set. Needless to say, getting a diamond in this game was a real windfall when I was a kid :o) -The Dog


Bugs:

- "Mr Do" (Taito) side-by-side test (read report). mrdot37b8ora Gary Walton


WIP:

-  2nd February 2002: Mike Coates fixed scrolling in Mr. Do while flip screen is active.

- 0.37b10: Nicola Salmoria improved colors in Mr. Do!. Correct monitor/video frequency to 61.166569 Hz.

- 0.37b7: Added timing prom ($60 - not used).

- 0.36b10: Correct palettesize from 257 to 256 colors.

- 18th November 2000: Nicola Salmoria fixed a stupid bug in Mr. Do! color PROM decoding.

- 11th February 1999: Mirko Buffoni has made the interpolation stuff even better. Exed Exes example is about doubling with 50% transparent scanlines (left side), and Mr. Do! example is about doubling with linear interpolation (both sides) and 50% transparent scanlines (left side). All these things are of course off by default.

-  6th February 1999: Mirko Buffoni has made interpolation routines for MAME. You'll need a powerful machine for this: (it's like ZSNES).

- 0.34b8: Gareth Hall added Mr. Do! (bugfixed) and Lee Taylor added Yankee Do!.

- 0.34b6: Nicola Salmoria added Mr. Do! (Yukidaruma).

- 0.30: Tatsuyuki Satoh and Nicola Salmoria cleaned up the SN76496 emulation, now it is similar to the 8910 one and all games use Tatsuyuki's code. This affects several games, most notably the Mr. Do! series.

- 0.27: Increased the maximum number of digital audio channels from 8 to 16, so there are no more missing voices in the Mr. Do! games/clones (Castle, Run Run, and Kick Rider).

- 0.18: Added support for the original, Universal version of Mr. Do!. Nicola renamed the other, which has an additional Taito copyright notice, "mrdot".

STORY:

- Haif a century had passed since overpopulation forced human being to leave the Earth for new homes in space. Hundreds of huge space colonies floated around the Earth, and artificial worlds had been built within their walls... In these second homes, people lived out their lives from birth to death. It's Year 0079 of the Space century. The space city furthest from the Earth, Side 3, decleared its independence as the Kingdom of Zion, and proclaimed a war against the Earth, Federation government. Over a month of fight half the population both Zion and the Federation had died. People were terrified...

NOTE:

- I was playing around with MSH, when I noticed that on Hulk's stage (the gigantic merry-go-round) when you jump high enough for your character to end up behind the merry-go-round's "roof", the sprite masking will kick in and will mask the player's sprite out of the power bars and etc. I don't know if this is due to the raster effects not being emulated yet (or more sprite-priority issues), but it's certainly not what it should look like. This has been verified to happen on a real board. NeoGouki

0.01 [Nicola Salmoria]


NOTE:

- Pac-Man (Midway), Ms Pac Man (bootleg), Crush Roller, Pengo and Lady Bug are the first supported games in MAME.

- Sometimes the colours on the first level appear incorrect until you either die or finish the level. The original game does this as well, although it doesn't happen very often. It appears that this is triggered by insert a credit and pressing start at a certain point in the attract mode. Because most people add credits shortly after the game has finished booting up, this feature is more likely to appear in MAME than on an actual arcade machine.

- Your character in the game moves too slow; in the arcade you go much faster. The speed in mame is correct to the original game. However, many of the Ms. Pac-Man machines that are still in arcades have had been modified to speed up the gameplay. You can play this way by enabling cheats in MAME. Note: This is a 'built-in' cheat, and is accessed from the dip switch menu instead of the usual cheat menu. You don't need the cheat.dat file for this.

- In the Ms. Pac-Man intro, when the ghosts appear from right to left below the square, the movement is smooth but there's a little hiccup now and then. Has been verified that a real machine does the exact same thing.

- In the clone Ms. Pac-Man Plus: The prizes go through the walls. The game is a hack -- while the mazes that the characters follow have been changed, the prizes still follow the original mazes.


Bugs:

- mspacmab: On a (real) machine, Ms. Pac usually ends at level 134, occasionally it makes it as far as 141 but I've never seen it myself. In MAME it always ends at 141. I've only tested it on mspacmab, but I'm sure all the games based on mspacman code do it also since it's an unmapped read causing it. pacmanc060gre dwidel


WIP:

- 0.55: Added clone Ms. Pacman Champion Edition / Super Zola Pac Gal.

- 0.37b16: David Widel decrypted the original Ms. Pac Man. Added the original, Midway version of Ms. Pac-Man and clones Ms. Pac Attack. Ms. Pac-Man (bootleg) is now clone.

- 0.35b11: Victor Trucco added clone Pac-Gal.

- 0.30: Nicola Salmoria and Aaron Giles completely rewritten the Namco waveform audio subsystem. This gets rid of some artefacts in Pac Man (eating a ghost) and Ms Pac Man (eating dots while a fruit is bouncing).

- 0.18: Sprite placement in Pac Man, Ms Pac Man and Crush Roller should now be arcade perfect. Thanks to Richard Davies who verified it on a real machine.

SERVICE MODE:

- Press 4 + F3 ? to enter service mode.


Bugs:

- When flying diagonally, the hawk may either blink or completely vanish altogether until it changes direction. mtrap37b14gre Kurushimi


Possible Bugs:

- mtrap, mtrap3, mtrap4: I have not heard it mentioned here before, but has anyone noticed that Mouse Trap and clones have a hissing noise playing in the background during the boot-up test and throughout the game. No other exidy.c games seem to have this problem. Perhaps this is something similar to the sound issue on Burger Time? I checked, and this seems to have existed for quite a few versions. Tested with Official MAME .37b12 and 59. mtrap059gre Darkk


WIP:

- 0.36b8: Added cpu3 roms ($0, 1000, 2000, 3000) and audio Z80 CPU3 and HC55516 sound.

- 31st July 1999: Dan Boris added sound to Mousetrap, but it doesn't work right.

- 0.35b13: Eric Hustvedt added clones Mouse Trap (version 3) and (version 4).

-  2nd May 1999: Valerio Verrando resent the Mouse Trap driver with two clones added.

-  2nd March 1999: Eric Hustvedt has added another Mouse Trap clone.

- 28th February 1999: Eric Hustvedt added another Mouse Trap clone.

- 0.35b2: Added Custom sound to Mouse Trap.

- 0.31: Mike Balfour made accurate colors in Mouse Trap.

- 0.28: Mike Balfour did some fixes to the Exidy games (Venture, Mouse Trap, Pepper II). Collision detection is now supported, Venture is playable.

- 0.18: Marc Lafontaine provided drivers for Mouse Trap and Pepper II, which run on similar hardware (Pepper II is not complete yet). Collision detection doesn't work - in Mouse Trap, you can use keys 7 and 8 to simulate a sprite-to-character and a sprite-to-sprite collision.

STORY:

- Once upon a time a horrible monster came without warning upon an unsuspecting land and decimated everything in its path. The paradise land of Alurea was hit hard. It's people, having known peace for 1000 years, had forgotten the savagery of battle and the land was destroyed. Only the King's twin infant sons survived. Fifteen years later... The elder of the twins, the successor to the throne of Alurea, is preparing to set out on a quest for a legendary stone called "Dragon Blue Eyes". Legend says that if ever the kingdom is in trouble, "The Dragon Blue Eyes" will set all things right.

STORY:

- Once every year, it is decreed that those who have the will for glory, fame and wealth indeed shall meet in games of skill. A marathon will be their test on mystic isles of lore and whomsoever proves the best, more clever, faster than the rest will top the greatest score. To be the greatest you must use strong magic if you dare for on the isles your foes will choose the magic paths to make you lose unless you beat them there. But dangers lurk on land and seas to guard the treasures bright. So while you gather points with ease avoid the trolls, the rocks, the trees or you will feel their might. Above all, don't forget the race place third or better, friend. If you let magic slow your pace or treasures pull you from the chase your marathon will end...


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- Remember this is a race... so keep running. Use magic to cross between islands. Don't feed the fins.

- Caves will move you to the next cave.

- Magic bridges only move left and right.

- Holes will move you to the next hole.

- Birds, butterflies and balloons will fly you ahead if you catch them.

- The following objects score bonus points: Rubies, gold, pearls, diamonds and gold mushrooms.

- Beware the following hazards. They slow you down: Small and large rocks, red mushrooms, ferns, geysers, cactus and whirlpools.

0.34b7 [Alex Pasadyn, Zsolt Vasvari, Kurt Mahan]


SETUP:

- The first time you run the game, it will say 'DEFAULT ADJUSTMENTS RESTORED'. Press F2 to enter test mode and exit to start.


Bugs:

- When you go into test mode and try to change a setting (like violence level), the screen may go black, but the game still runs ... Note from TriggerFin: I was able to change 3 settings before this happened. narc055gre RingoWillyCat / TriggerFin

- narc (and clone): When in test mode, if you peform the synthesizer sound board test it reports 3 tones-ROM error U5 (occasionally I'll get 0 tones-no response check U5), upon completing the test, the sound board crashes, and all background sound is gone. But if you leave it alone and don't test the board, synth sound works fine in test mode and in game. Update: Now when performing the Synth Board self test, it no longer crashes the sound. The Synth board still isn't responding to communication. But instead of returning '3 Tones - ROM Error check U5' it returns '1 Tone - Synthesizer OK/Check J2 Cable'. So its improved some. See results. narc37b16yel Suppi-Chan


Possible Bugs:

- I have played this game with the final release, and I have noticed that there is a background noise all the time since the image is loaded. Probably a HC55516 sound problem. narc36finalgre Lord Caos / Suppi-Chan

- On the bridge level, you hear dog bark sounds all throughout the level, though they only appear visually for a brief moment. narc080u1gre Ekstreme


DIP/Input Bugs:

- Changing the language dip switch doesn't do anything. narc060gra DCisTHEbest


WIP:

- 0.63: Correct gfx1 roms addresses and graphics resolution to 512x400.

- 0.37b5: Added clone Narc (rev 3.20). Correct graphics resolution to 512x401.

- 17th July 2000: Aaron Giles submitted an update for the Williams drivers with perfect sound in Mortal Kombat II (thanks to Ernesto Corvi!) and fixed crashes in Narc.

- 15th March 2000: Aaron Giles fixed Narc from freezing.

- 27th February 2000: Aaron Giles fixed Narc from crashing.

- 0.36b16: Added Custom sound.

- 0.36b9: Correct TMS34010 CPU1 clock speed to 6MHz and YM2151 to 3579580 Hz.

- 0.36b7: Aaron Giles rewritten the HC55516 CVSD decoder. This affects Sinistar, Joust 2, Arch Rivals, Pigskin, Tri-Sports, Smash TV, Trog, Narc.

- 0.35b2: Added HC55516 sound and remove 1x DAC.

Samples required (5.41 MB - Cassette tape sample)


NOTE:

- The talk.wav restarts every time you crashed. This is a limitation of MAME, there is presently no way to have MAME "pause" a sample.


Bugs:

- When you shoot the wall (blue barriers and thin red walls on level 1). The area doesn't round out red walls in adjacent area. But area is blanked out with a point dot (on occasion ammo thingy). When you died on the level. The level is redrawn with all the walls rounded. natodef137b7gre AxE

- When things go BOOM! (It when you're shooting at the enemy). Objects remain at times. ie there would be 0 left on the board or half an enemy unit flashing away. natodef237b7gre AxE

- You can create a path through thin red walls (These are 1 point dot in thickness). Its appears that you should be able to shoot the barriers (blue objects on lvl 1). But I'm not sure about the red walls. natodef337b7gre AxE


WIP:

0.35b11 [Brad Oliver]

0.25 [Sal, John Bugliarisi]


Possible Bugs:

- naughtyb: In naughtyc, when you hit one of the question marks that appear on the playfield, a prize appears. You can then hit the prize to get bonus points, and sometimes another will appear in its place. But in naughtyb, if you hit the prize or try to pick it up, nothing happens. It just sits there and eventually disappears. This strikes me as very odd; perhaps that's just how the game is, but it doesn't make sense that prizes would appear that you can't get. I don't know how the bootleg set works, because I can't get very far in it. It seems to be set to "incredibly difficult" and there are no dip switches. naughtyb37b9gre The Dog

- 0.30: Brad Oliver added sound in Naughty Boy and Pop Flamer, using the Pleiads driver. Not very good, but it's a start.

- 0.29: Nicola Salmoria fixed bug in Naughty Boy coin insertion/start game handling. Virtu-Al and Nicola made accurate colors in Naughty Boy (probably).

- 0.25: Support for Naughty Boy. Sal and John Bugliarisi provided Nicola technical information about the game Naughty Boy. (Remember that code area is 64k long and not 32k).

0.34b7 [Alex Pasadyn, Zsolt Vasvari, Kurt Mahan]


Bugs:

- When you the glass shatters in the arcade (rarely happens when dunking). The game is suppose to slow down. The doesn't seem to happens in the MAME version. nbajam37b5gre AxE

- nbajam, nbajamte: The wrong players' names, those being players from different teams that are not currently playing, will be called out by the announcer. This usually occurs at least a few times a quarter. Occasionally, the wrong team name is announced. Occurs in both nbajam and nbajamte, but seems more frequent in nbajamte. With nbajam, it may only happen a few times per full game. Sometimes, a dozen or more times. nbajam078u3gre BSR


Possible Bugs:

- nbajamte, possibly other nbajam games: When playing and just selecting the Suns as is, so you are Majerle. When playing stats will be shown at the end of the half and end of the game. While playing with Majerle, his stats will be shown for Barkley. So if you take two shots with Barkley, Majerle's stats will show two shots. Then the oppisite is true, if you take 60 shots with Majerle, Barkley's stats will show 60 shots. I have not checked it with other teams or switching the players, ie having the CPU control Majerle. nbajamte064gre Pubily2

Bugs:

- The game crashes after the Chicago level. It will slow down first and then show a nice hex memory dump :p Note: This doesn't happen every time it's played. Update: This happens sometimes when you press buttons during any transitions. nbbatman055red Jonemaan / Kale

- The raster effects (like the intermission) works with the V33 CPU set to 23.4 Mhz and so on, but with a huge slowdown. nbbatman060ora Kale

Possible Bugs:

- If you set the play time longer than 8min 32secs, at the "How to Play" screen, the player's character sprite doesn't show and the timer's minute and second fields are blank. When the game starts, your character doesn't show at all (supposed to jump down from the top) and the game immediately ends asking if you want to continue. I tried this setting in Nebula and observed the same results as well so I'm guessing it might be a game bug. ncombat079u1gre arpinkor

Bugs:

- nebulray, nebulryj: There's a bad sprite clipping problem: There's two right triangles, gradient filled blue, slanted left, objects blocking the bottom half of the game screen. It doesn't appear to move, and it's layered between the background graphics and the foreground objects. Wierd thing is, during attract mode when it's tellling the story those two blue triangle objects are gone. But comes back when it shows the game in action again. The gradient triangles comes back in level 3, 5, 6 (last stage). In level 5 it comes back with only one triangle, and it's position on the left of the screen. One interesting note, levels 1,3,5,6 all has the same starfield background. Level 3,5, and 6 has a second layer of sprites to cover the starfield near the beginning, so it appears to go away midway through the stage. But in level 6 where the starfield comes back at the end, you see the two triangles again. Second thing I noticed. During the starfield stages, when large sprites (large battle ships or asteroids)reach the bottom of the screen, the sprite disappears when only half the object has passed the bottom of the screen area. For instance, each battleship consists of 4-5 large sprites put together to make up the ships body. When the first large sprite passes the bottom of the screen with 50% of it's body gone, the sprite disappears entirely, instead of flowing smoothly down the screen. What that means is that when a large sprite is 50% past the bottom of the screen it just disappears instead of continueing to flow down. This, for example, makes the battleship appear to break off when it reaches the bottom, even though it hasn't been destroyed. Update: This is fixed except the gradient triangle in level 5 (only one triangle on the left of the screen) is still visible (MAME 79u1). nebulray066gre AntneyChill / ClawGrip

0.10 [Nicola Salmoria]


NOTE:

- In clone 'nibblera' starting at level 32 you must complete each level on one life. If you die, you'll have to start it all over again. In 'nibbler', you don't. When you die, you simply pick up where you left off (at least as far as level 53).


WIP:

- 0.81u5: CCoder correct ROM names for Nibbler from manual.

- 0.81u4: CCoder hooked up SN76477 sound in Fantasy, Nibbler and Pioneer Balloon, correct CPU frequency from schematics, merged memory maps, cleaned up driver a bit, fixed dips and enabled debug inputs. Correct M6502 CPU1 clock speed to 1411125 Hz, removed Vanguard sampels, added SN76477 sound and correct dipswitches.

- 0.35b11: Valerio Verrando added a Nibbler (set 2).

-  3rd April 1999: Valerio Verrando added a Nibbler bootleg.

- 0.33b1: Nicola Salmoria added clone Nibbler (alternate) - Note that I also replaced a bad sound ROM in the previous set with the good one in this set.

- 0.31: Brian Levine made better sound in Nibbler.

- 0.28: Nibbler and Fantasy have sound, using the Vanguard driver. Mirko Buffoni don't know how accurate it is. Nibbler and Vanguard are back to (hopefully) normal speed.

- 0.23: Fixed Nibbler colors. Mirko Buffoni should say 100% correct colors, but he remember the Nibbler hairs were Green versus Purple. Maybe he played a bootleg version.

- 0.10: Nibbler support. This is the second 6502 game supported by MAME. Interesting hardware: no sprites, two playfields, and it uses RAM for character generation (redefining the characters to animate the worm).


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- Clear each maze before time runs out.

- Nibbler does not stop at corners and do not let Nibbler bite itself

- Extra Nibbler every 4 waves.

0.37b5 [David Graves, Nicola Salmoria]


NOTE:

- When you got the TIMER STOP in Ninjak, all the background graphics became black. You can only see the sprites (the background graphics that still can bee seeing are, in fact, sprites: objects that can be destroyed). I think that maybe there should be a SHADOW effect or something similar which maybe is not implemented. No one has come forward with any evidence supporting this theory, there is evidence against it. There is an unemulated sprite / tile blending feature used e.g. in Gunfront but this doesn't look like it. grav


Bugs:

- There's a priority issue eg. on the level with the blimp, the clouds are behind you and they should be in front of you. On the last board there are some clouds that I believe have the wrong priority as well. There's a note in the driver about sprite glitches but I can't really tell for sure if this particular issue is known. ninjak058gre Smitdogg

Because of the "Satanists" who wished the resurrection of Satan realized, the town became an unlawful town. But there is a ray of hope.

0.37b10 [David Graves]


NOTE:

- Pressing (or holding) button 3 whenever, pauses the game. There was no 3rd button in the arcade machine. This is a freeze input *deliberately* hooked up, it is not a bug. Possibly it would make sense to map as a DIP but that is a MAME preferred style issue. This is true of various other Taito games. grav

0.29 [Nicola Salmoria]


Samples required (Rally X)


WIP:

- 0.78u1: Stefan Jokisch added proms ($120, $140 - vertical sync (not used)) and removed New Rally-X (vertical hack), because the graphic hack (rotated tiles + display) not worth supporting.

- 0.62: Added clone New Rally X (Vertical Screen).

-  8th August 2002: Kurosan submitted a vertical screen hack of New Rally X to their respective drivers.

- 0.37b12: Correct gfx2 rom ($0 - dots) and monitor/video frequency to 60.606060Hz.

- 0.36b15: Added sound1 timing prom ($100 - not used).

- 10th July 1999: Nicola made a major improvement to Bosconian, Commando (Sega), Rally-X and the rest, adding a missing character PROM.

- 0.29: Support for New Rally X; colors are accurate in New Rally X ONLY - still wrong in Rally X until we find the color PROMs. Sound should finally be correct, both in Rally X and New Rally X.

0.81u6 [Tomasz Slanina]


WIP:

- 0.81u7: R. Belmont and Tomasz Slanina added ST-0016 stereo sound to the ST0016 driver. Neratte Chu and Renju Kizoku now have sound.

- 19th April 2004: R. Belmont - Got addicted to Neratte Chu, and that lead to reverse-engineering and hooking up sound and music for the ST-0016. Haze pointed out one critical detail I was missing, and now it sounds pretty good!

-  5th April 2004: Tomasz Slanina - More ST-0016 emulation progress with Nerrate Cyuh!

-  7th March 2004: Tomasz Slanina - More Seta ST-0016 stuff (in multicpu games only st-0016 is emulated): Neratte cyuh! (ST-0016) - Problems with rombanking.

SERVICE MODE:

- To enter service mode, press the blue nitro button (3P button 1) and then press the service switch.


NOTE:

- Gameplay seems a little bit slow, and it's not because of my computer. Note the clock speed. I've just got back from playing an actual, totally unmodified, slightly damaged original PCB and... MAME is right! The clock is a little screwy in the real thing! Probably due to some buggy timer, or setting things to 50HZ instead of 60 or something. El Condor

DIP/Input Bugs:

- When you insert a credit using 5, then you insert another credit using 6, it won't accept it. If you keep inserting it with 5, it gives you credits. Same goes if you start inserting coins in 6 first, then 5 won't give you credit. You can insert more credits using 6. So bottom line is that whatever you use first to insert the credit, thats the only credit button you can use. The other one won't work. I have tested this 059 thru 062. othldrby062gra Thenasty

Bugs:

- There are garbled graphics on the Taito logo screen (see snapshot). othunder074u1gre Nerox91

- In the good ending, when the airliner is taking off from the runway, there is a second airliner sprite above the first airliner sprite. This bug has been around for a long time now and I'm suprised no one has noticed it (see snapshot). othunder074u1gre3 Nerox91

- 18th August 2001: Guru - From Pelle arrive a ultra-rare Outfoxies (Namco 1994, NB-2) PCB. It has some surface-mounted ROMs on it, so it will take some time to dump it.

Bugs:

- outrun and clones: On the seaside level(stage4 if you go right at every junction), the smoking tyre problem on the wrong side I mentioned before is not the problem, on looking closely, there are white things flashing up on the screen, I think these are the beach hut sprites? outrun36b15gre Sixtoe

Bugs:

- Game acts up upon running out of time. It'll either bypass the countdown, show a "wrap-up" screen of your route and then reset or it'll just plumb crash MAME. It doesn't crash ALL the time. Or reset all the time. But the countdown is missing when it shows up...and the "wrap-up" screen is still miscoloured. overdriv37b13gre Sports Dude

Possible Bugs:

Emulation bug or ingame bug ? ozmawar2: Even if this game is a clone of 'ozmawars', the "bug" doesn't exist in this version. Could it be a newer version of the game, so it should be the main set ? solfight: Even if this game is a clone of 'ozmawars', the "bug" doesn't exist in this version.

0.34b8 [Nicola Salmoria]

0.33b1 [Ernesto Corvi]


NOTE:

- The round 19 layer on top starts when you reach a building and ends when you come out of it, which also suggests the effect is correct. grav

- The background layers on trip 19 appear to be out of order. Round 19, like round 27, puts a layer over most of the sprites so you only get to see the whites of their eyes: it then cuts out a "torch beam" in front of you so you can see just about enough of where you are going. It seems pretty clear that this is just meant to make these two levels harder (27 has black top layer so it's "Pacman at night in the woods"). The round 19 layer on top starts when you reach a building and ends when you come out of it, which also suggests the effect is correct. grav


WIP:

- 0.80: Nicola Salmoria fixed sprite RAM, it was too big and included normal program RAM, causing sprites to be drawn twice, fixed irq enable, fixed tilemap scroll offsets and sprite positions, accurate emulation of tile/sprite priority (including fix of bugs introduced when the driver was converted to tilemaps) and sprite visibility area and pacland36b16 is not a bug - colors match the real game. Correct M6809 CPU1 clock speed to 1536000 Hz and HD63701 CPU2 to 1536000 Hz.

- 30th January 2004: CCoder submitted a fix for flipscreen and flashlight effect in Pac-Land.

- 0.37b12: Correct monitor/video frequency to 60.606060Hz.

- 0.35RC2: Correct the HD63701 CPU2 clock speed to 1538461 Hz.

- 0.35b11: Nicola Salmoria fixed foreground transparency in Pac-Land round 19. Correct M6809 CPU1 and HD63701 CPU2 clock speed to 1.5MHz.

- 14th April 1999: Nicola fixed Pac-Land graphics priorities.

-  7th April 1999: Nicola Salmoria has updated Pac-Land and Rolling Thunder drivers to work on the new 6800 core, but music speed is still sometimes screwed.

-  2nd March 1999: Ernesto Corvi fixed Pacland and Rolling Thunder sound by emulating two new opcodes in the 63701 core.

-  1st March 1999: Ernesto Corvi has updated Pacland to support sound.

TEST MODE:

- Press P1 and P2 START together with F3 to enter test mode.


Bugs:

- On the first level, about half the pixels in the column near the bottom-left corner appear to be out of place and there are a couple of brown pixels on the ledge beside that column that should be on the horse statue's head on the other side of the screen. When you've played thru it to around level 6 or beyond, lose all your men, and start a new game, the pixels appear to be correct, the column appears correctly; most of the pixels on the entire screen have shifted. However, there are usually some stuck pixels (see the second linked screenshot, near the left bottom corner there is a brown line that didn't disappear). This usually gets stuck during stage transitions, when the pixels shift off the screen, and correct themselfves (disappear) a few levels later: save state (taken after a long game has been played, with pixels now displaying correctly/you can start a new game with it and the pixels are in place). I should also mention that every once in a while, a sound will get "stuck" on for a moment, doesn't sound correct to me but I suppose it could be because the hardware was so limited. pandoras058gre Smitdogg

Bugs:

- This is one of those things that's neither common nor consistent (AFAIK), but here goes... After level 30ish (when the background changes to the city at night), the music changes. This is fine, except that it changes even when the music playing is the "danger" music. It'll change back if you manage to get back under the danger level and then go back up again. The other thing, which ALSO only happens once the music has changed (from level 30(?) on), is that at some random point during a combo, it'll play the title sound (you'll hear it go "Gyakuten! Puzzle Bancho!"). If this happens when the danger music is playing, and the combo clears out enough to take you back under the danger level, it will continue to play the danger music until you manage to reach the danger level and then clear back under it. bpancho058gre Ashuime

WIP:

- 0.71: Razoola added clone Neo-Geo Puzzle Bobble / Bust-A-Move (Neo-Geo) (set 2).

- 0.53: Rename (pbobble) to (pbobblen).

- 0.37b16: Rename clone (puzbobb) to (pbobblbs).

- 13th June 2000: Jarek Burczynski added Hit the Ice, Puzzle Bobble (Japan, B-System), Quiz Sekai wa SHOW by shobai and Rambo 3 to the Taito-B driver. Nicola Salmoria fixed the sprite zooming code in the Taito-B driver.

- 0.35RC2: Nicola Salmoria incresed the horizontal resolution for NeoGeo to 320. This looks strange with some games, but it is definitely the correct value as I verified it on the real thing. Games like Puzzle Bobble and Baseball Stars use the extra area, while most of the other games draw just two bars in there. If a game looks odd, adjust your monitor to send the extra area offscreen.

Your contacts are: John Gordon, Robert Williams, David Straker, Lynda Baker, Martin Douglas and Daniel Leeds. Each contact will give you an ID card used to access the security room located in a different sector. Defeat the guards within the security rooms and grab the secret tape units. After you obtain all six tape units, you will gain access to the control center. At the control center you must defeat the guards to destroy the computer and restore order to society...

0.01 [Nicola Salmoria]


NOTE:

- Pac-Man (Midway), Ms Pac Man (bootleg), Crush Roller, Pengo and Lady Bug are the first supported games in MAME.


Bugs:

- On the emulated version, there appear to be objects that are either white in colour - or slightly off-white. On the arcade, I see no white whatsoever - just a pale pink. This pale pink applies to *everything*. All the text, the characters, the ice that the sno-bees move on. Everything. My PCB is an original with the encrypted ROMs. pengo37b8gre Gary Walton


WIP:

- 0.73: Added clone Pengo (set 3 not encrypted).

- 0.60: Added clone Pengo (bootleg).

- 0.37b12: Correct monitor/video frequency to 60.606060Hz.

- 0.28: Rewritten the decryption routines in Pengo and Crazy Climber.

- 0.27: Thanks to Gary Walton, speed in Pengo should now be closer to the original. The unencrypted versions of Penta and "pengopop" are no longer supported because they are just hacks, not coming from a real board. The *original*, *encrypted* versions are now supported instead. They are exactly the same, the only difference is that they are encrypted and come from real boards. The names now are: "pengo" original Pengo with "PopCorn" music, "pengoa" alternate version (earlier) with different music and no slow screen draw, "penta" the bootleg called Penta

- 0.26: Added support for two versions of Pengo (one with the music of Popcorn and a clone).

- 0.15: Brad Oliver fixed a illegal memory accesses bug in games using 224x288 and 288x224 modes (Pengo, Pac Man, Rally X).

- 0.01: Very special thanks to Sergio Munoz for the precious information about the Pengo sound hardware and colors.

0.18 [Marc Lafontaine]


TEST MODE:

- Press 5 + F3 for Test-Mode.


NOTE:

- MAME plays Pepper II about twice as fast as the arcade. Happens on the real machine. btribble

- The mazes start to blank out around the time it takes me to complete one screen. In MAME they don't blankout till much later. In the arcade the maze actually blanks out for a few seconds, then appears again, then blanks out for longer and longer, etc. When you die the maze reappears for a while. I wish I played the arcade more to know exactly how this works. Happens on the real machine. btribble


WIP:

- 0.31: Mike Balfour made accurate colors in Pepper 2.

- 0.28: Mike Balfour did some fixes to the Exidy games (Venture, Mouse Trap, Pepper II). Collision detection is now supported, Venture is playable.

- 0.18: Marc Lafontaine provided drivers for Mouse Trap and Pepper II, which run on similar hardware (Pepper II is not complete yet).

NOTE:

- Games will not accept credits with sound off. Note: The sound CPU also controls the coin inputs, so if it's disabled then so are the coin slots. If you need to run the game without sound (i.e. you don't have a soundcard), you can get around this by enabling cheats.


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- You are the Packrat! You love to gather bright and shiny objects. You want to see all of your objects back on your nest's wall.

- Meet "The Gang" - they want to stop you. Throw objects to stun them. You can ride some of the stunned animals for a while.

- Pick up all objects and bring objects back to nest.

- Throw objects to stun animals. Stunned animals may be ridden and tough rat can't be ridden.

- Walking on pipes makes you jump.

- Flashing animals won't kill you.

- Hit jump to let go of animal.

NOTE:

- Score suddenly increases by 200,000 points for no apparent reason Either by accident or design, the original game awards you with a whopping 200,000 points if you shoot three diagonal (200 point) birds in quick succession.


Bugs:

- "Phoenix" side-by-side test (read report). phoenix37b10ora garyw


Possible Bugs:

- During the demo, after the first game over, the last line low of the screen does not come cleaned up. In the last line there are still written the copyrights. The words are cancelled, only, from bullet that hit to them. Initially the copyrights are on three lines, therefore, the first two are cleaned up correctly only. This problem there isn't in clone versions, because the last line is empty. phoenix055gre zaxxon1

- Clone Batman Part 2: A little bit of red and yellow garbled graphics appear in the lower left corner of the screen, and yellow and purple garbled graphics sometimes flash above it on and off during gameplay. batman237b16gre Smitdogg

0.07 [Nicola Salmoria]


WIP:

- 0.35b8: Correct Z80 audio CPU clock speed to 1.789772 MHz.

- 18th March 1999: Zsolt Vasvari has added RC filter functions to all the games which use the Time Pilot sound board (early Konami games like Time Pilot, Pooyan, etc).

- 0.34b3: Nicola Salmoria added the original, Konami version of Pooyan.

- 0.31: Martin Binder made accurate colors in Pooyan. Jim Hernandez did music tempo and pitch in Locomotion, Time Pilot, Pooyan, Tutankham and Roc'n Rope should be accurate (He believe they all use the same sound board).

- 0.27: Nicola changed the 8910 sound chip emulation interface to allow updates more frequent than 60 per second. I also increased the sampling frequency to 44.1kHz. These changes provide dramatic improvements in sound quality, which you can appreciate in e.g. Gyruss and Pooyan. The price to pay is slower execution. To make things worse, I had to (hopefully temporarily) remove some optimizations, so the above games will probably not run as well as before on slower systems.

- 0.18: Some changes to music tempo in Amidar, Pooyan, Time Pilot.

- 0.15: Sound support in Pooyan.

- 0.12: Thanks to Mike Cuddy and Mirko Buffoni, Pooyan colors are now MUCH better.

- 0.07: Support for Pooyan (wrong colors, no sound).

SETUP:

- To use a Paddle, enable it in test mode, the default is joystick not paddle.


Possible Bugs:

- The service mode for popbounc allows an alternate controller, "paddle", to be used. MAME does not support this. It could require a different BIOS file, similar to (but not the same as) irrmaze, though it more likely just has never been implemented. Update :Could be because the home version used paddles. popbounc37b3gre TriggerFin


WIP:

- 0.76u2: Change input to dial.

- 0.74u1: Change input to trackball.

- 16th September 2003: David Haywood added paddle support to Pop 'n Bounce thanks to information from Leon van Rooij. 

- 10th May 2002: Dan Gendreau submitted a change to the Neo Geo driver so that Pop 'n Bounce can be controlled with a paddle.

SERVICE MODE:

WIP:

- 0.60: Correct monitor/video frequency to 60Hz.

- 22nd October 2001: William Kucharski sent in cocktail mode fixes for 1943 and Popeye.

- 0.53: Correct palettesize from 304 to 288 colors. Change description from Popeye (set 1) to Popeye (revision D) and (set 2) to (revision D not protected).

-  1st August 2001: Nicola Salmoria finally decrypted the original version of Popeye.

- 0.37b6: Added clone Popeye (rev. F).

- 25th June 1999: Mike Coates modified Popeye to be properly rotated.

- 0.35b2: Nicola Salmoria added clone Popeye (set 2) (not working due to encryption). Correct proms in (set 1).

- 0.33b2: Nicola Salmoria adjusted the brightess of the background in Popeye, which should make it correct according to the schematics. Maybe now it's too dark?

- 0.27: Popeye runs at the correct speed of 30 fps.

- 0.26: Mauro Minenna introduced a new option (-dir4) that simplify the use of the joysticks to be connected on the keyboard. This modify resolves the problem of diagonal direction in games such as PacMan, Popeye, and Kung Fu Master.

- 0.23: Some fix to Popeye and Burgertime sound pitch.

- 0.20: Thanks to Marc LaFontaine's invaluable help, Popeye is now fully playable and has 100% accurate colors. Supports high score saving, too. Still very slow.

- 0.19: Thanks to Marc LaFontaine we have now support for Popeye. It's not yet playable (when the game starts the machine resets) but it has music already. It's also very slow, since it uses a 512x480 screen. Mirko Buffoni is looking for decryption scheme for original Popeye board using Lionel's idea (pain!).

- After the Bonus Round in level 4, when you are about ready to jump out of the water there is a line glitch beneath you. Also, the sky on the same screen looks incorrect. pulirula056gre_2 Karasu

0.31 [Nicola Salmoria]


WIP:

- 0.58: Full VLM5030 sound emulation. Samples are no longer needed.

- 22nd January 2002: Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed the noise generator in the VLM5030 sound chip emulation, completely removing the need for samples.

- 21st January 2002: Tatsuyuki Satoh submitted a new, much improved version of the VLM5030 sound chip emulation, used for speech in (Super) Punch-Out and a few other drivers. It is now more than 90% accurate to the original, and only a few small problems remain.

- 17th November 2000: Gerardo Oporto fixed dipswitches in Punchout.

- 0.37b5: Nicola Salmoria added new graphic primitive copyrozbitmap(). This replaces copybitmapzoom() which was a special case. A side effect is that, thanks to the better precision, the boxer on the Punch Out hall of fame looks much better.

- 0.36b13: Replace the NES and DAC sound with Nintendo. Correct the clock speed of the N2A03 to 1789772 Hz.

- 26th December 1999: wwtk@mail.com and Matthew Conte contributed a new NES sound driver for Punch Out and Donkey Kong 3, and also some fixes to SNK games sound.

- 0.36b5: Replace the M6502 CPU with a N2A03.

- 0.33b6: Tatuyuki Satoh fixed bug in VLM5030 emulator which caused samples not to work.

- 0.33b3: Tatsuyuki Satoh updated VLM5030 emulation (Punch Out etc.). Since quality is still bad, the emulator is only used when samples are not avaialble.

- 0.31: Nicola Salmoria did a first attempt at sound in Donkey Kong 3 / Punch Out. These two Nintendo games use the same sound hardware as the NES console.

WIP:

- 0.36b12: Correct Z80 CPU2 clock speed to 6MHz.

- 0.36b11: Added clone The Punisher (US). Change from Custom to QSound (4MHz).

-  3rd July 1999: Paul Leaman fixed several CPS-1 graphics problems such as the missing van in Punisher and some others.

- 0.35b4: Added Z80 CPU2 (4MHz).

- 0.35b3: Added The Punisher (World) and clone (Japan).

- 13th February 1999: More progress on the CPS1 driver. Some of the later CPS1 games utilizing the Q-sound system are now working (such as Cadillacs & Dinosaurs, Punisher and Warriors of Fate), and a few minor bugs have been fixed. No sound though, because the Q-sound roms are encrypted. Information about 'Kabuki' encryption system is very welcome.

0.37b8 [Bryan McPhail]


NOTE:

- Appears to have 2 player support but player 2's game seems inaccessible. Insert one coin in each slot, you will see it ask 1 or 2 player. Press Player 2 Start. The game works in this really stupid (fact, not opinion) manner: Player 1, using Player 1 controls, plays his entire game, enters initials for high score, continues if desired. When done, Player 2, using a separate set of controls, plays the game. TriggerFin


Bugs:

- Possible bad dump? I realize that it mentions that there's problems with the tilemaps on "later levels" (specifically, 5-1 and 5-2), but the author of the driver attributes it to possibly the cheats. I'm pretty sure that it's because of a bad dump, though, of the ROM that contains the tilemaps - the last 20% or so of it is totally blank (null bytes). pushman058ora Ashuime


WIP:

- 0.79: Added Pushman. The old version is now clone Pushman (American Sammy license).

- 23rd January 2004: Aaron Giles fixed Pushman.

TODO:

* Emulate Votrax SC-01 speech synthesizer


NOTE:

- To enter your name in the high score list, use 1 or 2.

- When the Auto Round Advance dip switch is On, use 1 or 2 to advance to the following round. You also get infinite lives.


Bugs:

- According to this story on coinop.org, Q*Bert (driver gottlieb.c) is supposed to say "Hello, I'm turned on" when it is powered up. This is not emulated. It's in the latest sample set from Dith (and you can hear in the sound test in the service mode). IIRC, MAME emulated the startup sound (as well as Q*Bert saying "Bye-Bye") a long time ago (probably about the time Dith updated the samples), but it is no longer there anymore. It is supposed to be there, however. Update: The "Hello, I'm turned on" sound does play in service mode (its sound code is 28). Another Update: I looked at a Q*bert instruction manual and this might be a clue to solve qbert37b14gre1. It states that when the game is powered-up there is a 10 second delay before attract mode starts. In qbert's MAME emulation the attract mode begins immediately. Maybe the "Hello I'm turned on" sound occurs during that 10-second absense? Also, the manual states "Depressing any control button - The instruction set will now appear on the playing field and follow through game play and strategies". To me that means that during attract mode if you press and control button the instructions will be display on screen but that doesn't occur. qbert37b14gre1 Kurushimi / The tECHIDNA / Randolph

DIP/Input Bugs:

- This issues seems to be somewhat related to the Dynamic Dip Switch issue. The Dip option "Unused" on the bottom of the Tab menu is to change the way to control. When it's off, it is for 1 lever, 1 button and select button as current MAME. When it's on, it's for 4 button + select button (no lever, quiz game panel), and the game's interface changes accordingly. Correspondence of the control: Up -> Button 1, Down -> Button 2, Right-> Button 3, Left -> Button 4, Button1-> Select Button and Start -> Unused. You can check the change in the test mode. Update: The Dip Switch is now documented, but the Inputs still don't change in the UI due to dynamic Dip Switches issues. qcrayon237b9gra Fujix / stephh

0.23 [John Butler, Ed Mueller]


SETUP and TEST MODE:

- The first time you run the game, it will ask the language. You can use F1 to proceed through all the configuration screens, or just reset (F3). To change the language afterwards, delete the QIX.NV file from the NVRAM-directory and re-run the program.

- Press F2 to enter test mode, then F1 to advance to the next test. There are no dip switches, press F1 to enter the service mode, then F1=Next screen, F2=Next line, F5=Up, F6=Down.


NOTE:

- Qix uses two 6809 CPUs: one for data and sound and the other for video. The third CPU, a 6802, is used for sample playback. It drives an 8-bit DAC and according to the schematics a TMS5220 speech chip, which is never accessed. ROM u27 is the only code needed. A sound command from the data CPU causes an IRQ to fire on the 6802 and the sound playback is started.


DIP/Input Bugs:

- I cannot get any of the games that use this driver (qix.c) to play in cocktail mode. Setting the table mode bit to 1 in the software dipswitches has no effect at all (as per zookeeper.pdf manual (the qix upright manual doesn't mention it)). qixc071u2gra marc


WIP:

- 0.37b16: Correct audio M6802 CPU3 clock speed to 921600 Hz and set palettesize from 256 to 1024 colors.

-  1st August 1999 John Butler modified Qix to draw straight to screen bitmap.

- 0.35RC1: Al Kossow added clone Qix (set 3).

-  9th June 1999: Al Kossow added another version of Qix.

- 0.35b3: Nicola Salmoria added clone Qix (set 2).

- 0.31: John Butler merged the Qix and Zookeeper drivers, they now also support rotation.

- 0.30: Aaron Giles added sound in Qix and support dirty rectangles in Qix.

- 0.28: John Butler added optimizations to some Williams games, GnG and Qix. He also fixed several problems in Qix.

- 0.23: John Butler and Ed. Muller provided a driver for QIX!  High Score saving supported too.


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- Controll your Marker with joystick.

- To draw stix press Fast or Slow.

- Claim areas by joining walls with stix.

- Scores based on area: 250 points for Fast Score and 500 points for Slow Score.

TODO:

* Correct colors


Bugs:

- quantum and quantum1: Not entirely sure what causes this, but I verified that MAME emulates Quantum (both revisions) a bit slow as compared to the original PCB. (I played two separate Quantum machines this weekend at California Extreme.) It seems to be a difference of about 10-20% - the place I notice the difference the most is in the death sequence: * Hit an object: Buzz + "Charging Up" sound,* All objects scale in with the collision point as center, * Dots scale out from center point + 2 explosion sounds, one after the other. The amount of time between each of these points is between 10% and 20% shorter on the original PCB as opposed to the emulator. MAME doesn't indicate any performance problems and shoots up past 500% when I hit F10, so I know that it is not a MAME performance issue. My guess as to this issue is that there's a small timing inaccuracy in the emulator core. quantum055yel Dorsola

- 0.30: Andy White did Radarscope to works. Ron Fries, Dan Boris and Mirko Buffoni support 8039 emulator, and _emulated_ sound in Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Mario Bros. Since the boards also use discrete circuits to generate sound, some samples are still needed to get complete sound support. Also partial sound in Radarscope.

- 0.29: Nicola Salmoria added Radarscope (untested due to lack of good ROMs).

NOTE:

- Rad Mobile was the first 32-bit game released by Sega, running on the new Sega System 32 equiped with a RISC processor and superior video hardware. This game includes some nice features: Dynamic weather, both day and night driving, incoming traffic, police chases, the ability to choose paths on later levels, etc. This game has a vast amount of different sceneries, a quality that most games lacked.


WIP:

- 0.78: Change the number of player buttons, year to 1991 and add unknown dipswitches.

- 28th November 2002: David Haywood sent in another update to the Sega System 32 driver with protection fixes for Burning Rivals, Arabian Fight and Golden Axe 2 from R.

WIP:

- 0.81u7: Brian Troha correct the dipswitches and added 'Bonus Life'.

- 12th April 2004: Olivier Galibert improved Raiden 2 sprites a little further, though they're still not perfect (the game itself is not playable because of banking / protection issues).

- 12th April 2004: David Haywood - Given some sprite gfx to work with I decided to improve the sprite emulation in raiden 2, this allows the title screen to be drawn. Game still isn't playable due to protection & banking issues.

- 0.81u3: Correct graphics resolution to 240x304, changed cpu1 roms to user1 and gfx3 roms addresses.

- 0.81u2: Improve Raiden 2 decryption.

- 0.81u1: Added clones Raiden 2 (easier?), (set 2, Metrotainment), (set 3, Japan) and (set 4, Japan). Added partial Raiden 2 sprite decryption (check sprite gfx with viewer (F4))

-  2nd April 2004: Raiden 2 sprites were partially decrypted and background emulation was improved but the game isn't playable due to protection and banking issues, and sets including New Zero Team were added to the driver but they don't do much.

0.31 [Mike Coates]


NOTE:

- In a secret room, you can make the screen scroll to the NEXT secret room. This occurs because the c-chip is returning a room_height value of 0x0999 (verified with a real c-chip). In Rainbow Islands, you should recieve a bonus of 5,000,000 points if you enter all 10 secret rooms in the game, or 1,000,000 points for entering the LAST one (the main difference is that you missed one or more). There is a counter for this purpose at $10D05C, however, this set _never_ updates this variable, and so the 'big bonus' cannot be achieved. The alternate version of Rainbow Islands (rainbowa) fixes BOTH of these bugs, by adding code to 3 routines in the game. Rainbow Islands Extra also has these 'fixes' to the code in place. Not bugs. ClockWork Orange

- In Rainbow Islands Extra, the powerup you receive is based on the LAST diamond collected. (no, you still need to collect the 7 diamonds in order, but you can still collect diamonds after you've finished this) anyways, if the last diamond is: you get: Red = Book of Continues, Orange = Money BAG (NOT coin!), Yellow = Key, Green = Protection Fairy, Blue = Yellow Potion, Indigo = Red Potion and Violet = Shoes. Now, some of these are different then in Rainbow Islands: 1.Money bag, a 100,000 point money bag will fall on each level (random time). Unlike the Coin in RI, it will NOT turn all hidden fruit into 10,000pt money bags. 2.Key, the rooms 'secret code' will be revealled for about 8 seconds. In RIE, only the first digit, and one more (depending on the LAST diamond you got) are normally revealled. 3.Protection Fairy - In RIE, the protection fairy is NOT permanent as it is in RI. It will last for a short duration at the beginning of every round, or after you die/start a new man. - THIS IS INTENTIONAL, the code that handles the protection fairy is modified to do just this. Not bugs. ClockWork Orange

Samples required


NOTE:

- rallyx and all clones/variations Right at the beginning of the game if you go immediately down thereby crashing into the competitor's car, you won't die. You drive right through it. This is not a bug, but a short period of invincibility, same thing happens on the real machine. Bugfinder

- In every challenging stage, get all flags but two: L and any other one. Then wait for fuel run out (the red cars start after you), right after that, take the L. The red cars stop and you can run forever in the maze until you get the last flag. The same thing happens on the real machine. Bugfinder

- Smoke disappear when off-screen: The problem is that in order to make the smoke persistant they'd need a copy of the entire tilemap for the entire level in RAM (normally the map data and characters are in ROM on that hardware) and Rally-X simply doesn't have enough RAM to do it. R. Belmont 


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The video mixer of this hardware is peculiar.

- There are two 16-colors palette banks: the first is used for characters and sprites, the second for "bullets".

- When a bullet is on screen, it selects the second palette bank and replaces the bottom 2 bits of the tile palette entry with its own, while leaving the other 2 bits untouched. Therefore, in theory a bullet could have 4 different colors depending on the color of the background it is drawn over; but none of the games use this peculiarity, since the bullet palette is just the same colors repeated four time. This is NOT emulated.

- When there is a sprite under the bullet, the palette bank is changed, but the palette entry number is NOT changed; therefore, the sprite pixels that are covered by the bullet just change bank. This is emulated by first drawing the bullets normally, then drawing the sprites (with pdrawgfx so they are not drawn over high priority tiles), then drawing the pullets again in TRANSPARENCY_PEN_TABLE mode, so that bullets not covered by sprites remain the same while the others alter the sprite color.

- The tile/sprite priority is controlled by the top bit of the tile color code. This feature seems to be disabled in Jungler, probably because that game needs more color combination to render its graphics.

NOTE:

- P3 buttons 1 and 2 are mapped twice. THIS IS NOT A BUG!


Bugs:

- Rampart still seems to have cosmetic issues, even now that the slapstic emulation is complete. Sound FX / Sound Items come at the wrong times occasionally, such as having the announcer yell "Cease Fire" while you are building your castle, or hearing cannon sounds go off during the build round. Playback on the trackball version (original romset 'rampart') will often cut out and go blue screen, which leads me to believe that either sound or control is still not properly emulated in the game (trackball movement is pathetically slow in the game, much slower than the arcade). I'm unsure if the last thing I noticed is a bug or not: ships disappear sometimes after the 'Destruction' round, which may be a bug, but more importantly, if that ship was beached before disappearing, it can still drop off armies the next round, even though it isn't there.

NOTE:

Bugs:

- Every time you finish a level, the game tallies up the score, kills, in a end level menu like Terminator 2. The end level menu doesn't show up, and all you see is a black screen except for the status bars at the top. You can here the soundfx of the end level menu while the menu is black. Not only that, but the screen stays black after, when you have to select levels or watching cut-scenes after the end level menu. Then everything returns to normal when you start a new level (see snapshot). revx060gre Nerox91

- rimrockn and clones: A multiplayer game is not possible, and the game starts automatically when coins are inserted. Other notes: There are startbuttons for 4 Players. And there are 4 coin-slots. Depending on which coin-slot you use, the corresponding player is active and the type of game can be chosen. By activating player 1 the then following drawingboard shows correctly the button-functions and after that the 1-player match begins. By activating players 2-4 the drawingboard is totally blank.

NOTE:

- Robby Roto (c) 1981 Bally Midway, (c) 1999 Jay Fenton, is for free non-commercial uses. Authorization: From: Jay Fenton <jay@fentonia.com> To: gridle@mbnet.fi   Date: 5.6.1999 2:11   Subject: Robby Roto ROM released for free non-commercial uses by author/owner. I used to write games for Bally/Midway in the 1970's and early 1980's. One of my less successful titles was Robby Roto. My contract with Midway specified that after shipments dropped below a certain level, that the rights to this game reverted to me. Needless to say, this has happened. I notice that Robby Roto is available on a few download sites for MAME. I would like the world to know that as the legal owner, the ROM images from Robby Roto are hearby declared free for unlimited non-commercial duplication and play by MAME users. Jay Fenton

Bugs:

- Report from a PCB owner: I went to repair a Rod-Land PCB this weekend. Grabbed the roms, burned the replacements for a couple of suspected failed chips, and .... Total garbage on screen instead of sprites and backgrounds. Backgrounds made from a mess of sprites and vice versa. Switching roms rl_23.rom and rl_14.rom fixes this - someone has them the wrong way around in the romset, and thus in the driver too ;-) I don't think we can really argue with the PCB on this matter. All seemed well, until I tested the "hidden" Rod-Land levels (coin, 3x up or 3x down depending on region, start). Backgrounds a jumbled mess of tiles. I tested it again in mame, looked fine there. PCB did not agree. I took a look at the driver source, and noticed where a rom image is read in non-sequentially, in blocks of a mishmash order. WHile it might work to have a jumbled up rom read for a jumbled rom, it's definitely not valid on the PCB. After a few minutes with a hex editor I've rearranged the romfile to match the layout of the hack, burned it, and that works fine. So - to recap, rl_23.rom is jumbled up and wrong, and 23/14 are switched, both problems exist in rodland.zip. Maybe someone wants to fix it, mail me at james@bloodflowers.org if you want the repaired 23 image. Oh, aside from that - the Japanese PCB I've got actually appears to use world region rl_23.rom and rl_14.rom - I tried the jap region images first and the board didn't like them at *all*. The only japanese romset ones my board runs with are 1, 2, 3 and 4 - rest same as world version. rodland061ora bloodflowers

TEST MODE:

- If you press the RIGHT arrow, the game resets itself, and goes back to the initial test. Most of the mahjong games (namely the Nichibutsu ones) do not require a joystick; you just use the coins, start buttons, and buttons A-N (+ other action keys) for input. Pressing right in Royal Mahjong is supposed to clear the memory, according to the source.

NOTE:

- Silver Land shouldn't be a clone of River Patrol, it's a totally different game (skiing instead of boat rescue), made by someone else! It's just a cleverly-disguised bootleg. I think it was Zsolt who stated this when the games were first added. It used to be mentioned in one of the text files that came with MAME, but I think it got wiped out once gamelist.txt became automatically generated. The Dog

0.37b14 [Luca Elia, Phil Stroffolino]


Bugs:

- Side-by-side test (read report). I assume the fact that the voices are missing is known since it says samples in the todo, but... There's a loud "HWUUG" grunt as soon as you turn it on. There's a deep evil laugh during the intro when the bad guy jumps on the table and a female voice shouts "go" or something at the start of the level. I noticed in MAME if you hit reset, sometimes it won't play Bach's tocatta and fugue in d minor during the intro instead, just the teletype noise. The only graphic difference I noticed is when they show the map at the start of a level there's a yellow L shape flashing at the bottom, it's insert coin on my board. rranger060ora dwidel

- A piece of the yellow box on the map screen after the game start is also over the CREDIT text. rranger057gre MASH

TODO:

* Correct colors

* ROM NEEDS REDUMP:  247-a05 (higher banks and the second half of lower banks filled with 0xff)


SETUP:

- You must hold down F2 and press F3 to init the EEprom otherwise the game won't boot.


WIP:

- 0.78u1: Brian Troha added clones Run and Gun (World ver. EAA 1993 10.4) and (US ver. UBA 1993 10.8).

- 27th December 2003: Fabrice Arzeno and Brian A. Troha added two new Run and Gun ROM sets.

- 0.71u1: Acho A. Tang did many improvements to Run and Gun making it playable (single screen game only). Correct Z80 CPU2 clock speed to 10MHz.

- 0.63: Added Run and Gun (World ver. EAA) and clones Run and Gun (US ver. UAB) and Slam Dunk (Japan ver. JAA).

-  7th December 2002: R. Belmont added the PSAC2 background graphics layer and sound emulation to Run and Gun, but it's still unplayable due to problems with the inputs. Nicola Salmoria fixed the EEPROM init and couple of minor things in Run and Gun as well.

-  1st June 2002: R. Belmont submitted a preliminary driver for Run & Gun.

- 10th November 2001: Guru - Dumped the Euro version of Run & Gun (Konami 1993). I noticed that the current dumps of Run & Gun are incorrect, since 2 of the program ROMs (the common-to-all-versions Mask ROMs) are dumped as 4M when they are really 8M. These are program ROMs, so the emulation would go no-where without proper dumps. Hopefully that will excite someone enough to complete the emulation of it.

- 31st July 2000: Guru - Dumped Run & Gun (2 alt sets, Konami 1993).

WIP:

-  4th March 2002: David Haywood improved the backgrounds in Space Bomber and Gunbird 2, but they still aren't perfect and Strikers 1945 II isn't improved at all.

-  1st March 2002: R. Belmont fixed a bug in the SH-2 CPU core which fixes the missing background graphics in Strikers 1945 II, although they still aren't perfect due to other unemulated features.

- 22nd February 2002: David Haywood reported some more progress with the newer Psikyo games. Most color problems are fixed, Sol Divide also works and Daraku Tenshi - The Fallen Angels also works almost up to the actual game but crashes at that point. The background graphics in Strikers 1945 II and Space Bomber are still missing, though.

- 21st February 2002: David Haywood reported some progress in emulating Hitachi SH-2 based Psikyo games. Strikers 1945 II and Space Bomber are playable, although they miss a lot of graphics, have some wrong colors and no sound.

-  4th January 2002: Guru - Dumped Strikers 1945 II.

- 16th September 2001: Guru - Received Strikers 1945 II (Psikyo 1997). Thanks go to Smitdogg for the donations.

When the fighters are close enough for the camera to zoom, everything looks fine when jumping, when the fighters are further apart, such that the camera zooms out, when jumping the warping effects no longer appear in MAME, but do still appear, though to a lesser extent on my MVS. This is especially visible on stages like Galfords. samsho337b16gre Mr_Plough

WIP:

- 25th February 2002: R. Belmont fixed the EEPROM code in the Psikyo SH-2 games and David Haywood added preliminary background graphics support to Space Bomber, unfortunately it doesn't work in any of the other games.

- 22nd February 2002: David Haywood reported some more progress with the newer Psikyo games. Most color problems are fixed, Sol Divide also works and Daraku Tenshi - The Fallen Angels also works almost up to the actual game but crashes at that point. The background graphics in Strikers 1945 II and Space Bomber are still missing, though.

- 21st February 2002: David Haywood reported some progress in emulating Hitachi SH-2 based Psikyo games. Strikers 1945 II and Space Bomber are playable, although they miss a lot of graphics, have some wrong colors and no sound.

TODO:

* Hook up music (YM3931)


Bugs:

- There is a priority bug when you fight the "green monsters" at stage 5/6. Their green missiles go behind the space background and become "invisible", making avoiding them a hassle (save state in .71u2). Update: Also, at the Stage 5 boss, the boss' entire bullet sequence will *sometimes* not even appear at all even though it still damages your character. It seems to occur a lot if you jump just before he unleashes (save state in .71u2). I'm pretty sure that I noticed a couple of other enemy types in the game whose bullets were 'cut short' not long after they were released, but still did damage after they disappeared too soon. Much along the lines of the initial bug report originally mentioned above. There's basically sprite priority problems with some types of enemy bullets at different points in the game sdgndmps058gre Kale / Twisty

Samples required (Seawolf)


TODO:

* Add discrete sound


NOTE:

- Sample sound: You will notice that the start of the sound effects are re-trigered, causing the effects to sound weird. This is because the original sound board keeps retriggering the effect to provide a slower attack effect. Instead of using a resistor to charge the volume cap, it pulses the effect on/off to set the intial volume. So until Derrick Renaud write the discrete code, this will get some basic sound.


SERVICE MODE:

- Service mode dip switch turns on memory test. Reset with 2 pressed to get to an input check screen, reset with 1+2 pressed to get to a convergence test screen.

Bugs:

- (The dump) was the most common in the arcades. Guile and Dhalsim had a glitch which could reset the machine (see linked description). However, in MAME, this *doesn't* reset the machine. As this happens in the 68k C core *and* asm core, *and* in Callus too, I don't know where the bug comes from... maybe an error in the official documentation of cps1 hardware or the 68000 cpu (?). Update: SF2 now resets as the real thing when you do the bug with Guile, it still doesn't reset with Dhalsim. sf237b7gre Jonemaan

Bugs:

- Streetfighter 2 Turbo is (possibly?) running too fast, it has been compared side by side with a sf2 turbo arcade cabinet and it in tandom with MAME - MAME is too fast, it gained 5 seconds speed in a full round of 99 seconds, as I said this has been proved side by side running full frame rate. Note: It's likely due to the cpu speed being 12 mhz instead of 8 mhz. More: Antos has compiled some more information on this issue. You can read it here. Another update: E-mail from the Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting designer: Read it here. Another update: On some stages like Dhalsim's, there's an awful lot of "popping" sounds, pretty much identicle to what it sounds like it you run it unthrottled. I know there was some of this on the real machine, but I certainly don't remember this much. So maybe that's more of a reason that it may be running too fast(?) sf2t37b8yel Sixtoe / Antos / Smitdogg

- Clone sf2accp2: The clone sf2accp2 does not POST. The other clones of sf2ce start up ok. Update: This can be eliminated by reenabling a few lines of code in vidhrdw/cps1.c. Specifically, if the following code (line 466 onwards) is reenabled by re-positioning the "#if 0" to below it then the game will post correctly. sf2accp2070u5red Zanac / TriggerFin / Treble Winner


Possible Bugs:

- I hear at least a *small* crackling in the music throughout the game at all sampling rates (3 of them). I also hear occasional crackling when the bonuses are tallied. Update: The bug happens on Capcom's PSX port of SF2CE ("Street Fighter Collection 2") as well. Most noticeable in Ken's stage. Might it be that it does happen in the original machine (not a bug)? sf2ce36rc1gre TriggerFin/Jeff B / Takuma Sakazaki

0.77 [Aaron Giles]


HardDisk required


WIP:

- 0.82u2: Aaron Giles marked sfrush and vaportrx as working. Added also more extensive documentation on the various boardsets, constants for the GT64010 and all interrupts and ethernet device interrupt support. Made the IDE controller visible on the PCI bus, formalized support for the "widget" board used in vaportrx & calspeed, hooked up CMOS protection bit and corrected sfrushrk audio CRCs and hooked up hard disk.

- 14th May  2004: Aaron Giles - The ethernet controller was the missing link in San Francisco Rush, which is now playable (if you have a 20 GHz computer, of course). Unfortunately, there still seems to be something wrong with San Francisco Rush: The Rock, but hopefully I'll have it figured out. On the plus side, it turns out that a missing ethernet controller was also the cause of Vapor TRX not working as well, so now that is playable. By the way, a number of people were wondering why the Vapor TRX CHD is so big. Well, it turns out that the entire attract mode is pre-rendered movies, which explains a lot!

- 11th May 2004: Aaron Giles - Decided to take a breather from core work and got San Francisco Rush: The Rock up and running. It has the same problems as the original San Francisco Rush in that it hangs at the start of the game, but now I finally have a theory for why. The Rush games included an Ethernet controller onboard, and I'm currently suspicious that they want it to work. I've got some rudimentary basics up and running, and they are detecting that there is no cable connected, and then putting the Ethernet controller into loopback mode. Which tends to reinforce my suspicion that their networking model relies on even local data being sent/received in loopback mode. We'll see once I get everything wired up!

-  8th May 2004: Aaron Giles - A San Francisco Rush: The Rock hard drive showed up and I've got it limping along a bit, but there are still some serious issues to solve before it's ready.

- 0.77u3: Aaron Giles fixed input ports for California Speed and SF Rush. Correct graphics resolution to 512x400 and add 'Boot ROM Test' dipswitch.

- 0.77u2: Correct R5000 CPU1 clock speed to 200 MHz.

-  5th November 2003: Aaron Giles sent in the Atari Seattle driver, supporting CarnEvil, Blitz 99, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, Mace: The Dark Age (all working fine) and San Francisco Rush (freezes when starting a game).

- 27th May 2003: Aaron Giles updated the IDE controller emulation to support a couple more commands and added DMA bus mastering support that will be necessary for the Seattle games.

-  9th November 2002: Guru - Dumped San Francisco Rush (Atari 1996, including 3.2GB HD). Thanks to Mr. F.

< Japan >


Bugs:

- The game speed in MAME is totally faster than the real arcade (not sound). The best point for speed adjustment is the following: In the title screen, you can see Japanese text "2P..." repeats turning on and off, the blinking frequency is just 1 sec in the arcade. *Update* Reference materials for shagha3237b7gre (2.1M). It contains 3 movies and 2 oscillators' pictures on the PCB to refer for adjusting speed of shangha3. shangha3237b7gre Fujix

- According to the shangha3.c file > shangha3: >- The zoom used for the "100" floating score when you remove tiles is very rough. But, scaling or zooming effect is not used when you do it in the real arcade. shangha3337b7gre Fujix

0.37b14 [Phil Stroffolino]


TEST MODE:

- Reset the game while pressing Coin 1 or 2 to enter the "test mode"


NOTE:

- After the first demo runs, the sprites that make up the SHANGHAI KID logo aren't erased from the screen / RAM until they are drawn over. Not a bug - the real machine in the arcade has the same behavior. Stroff


Bugs:

- In the later levels, possibly due to uncracked protection, shangkid's sound starts to get really screwy, with samples being replaced by loud, horrible static. This is especially noticable in level 8 (where you fight the pro wrestler). Update: One of the CPUs is a dedicated sample player. The bad sound is a bankswitching issue. shangkid37b14gre1 Kurushimi / Stroff


WIP:

- 0.63: Added clone Hokuha Syourin Hiryu no Ken.

- 16th March 2001: Phil Stroffolino sent in an update to the Shanghai Kid driver, using the correct protection module ROMs and with other fixes.

- 18th February 2001: Phil Stroffolino sent in an almost completely working Shanghai Kid driver.

- 24th January 2001: Phil Stroffolino added Chinese Hero to the preliminary Shanghai Kid driver, but unlike Shanghai Kid, it doesn't have protection so it works perfectly.

- 22nd December 2000: Guru - The Shanghai Kid WIP got updated with a new driver and some technical info on the rom code.

-  4th December 2000: Guru - Been working with Mamedev to try to get Data East's Shanghai Kid up and running. I have a non-working pcb and it was necessary to open up the epoxy-encased protection module to see what was inside. The epoxy block contains a small pcb with a few surface-mounted chips on it. A Z80 cpu, LS245 logic IC and the infamous battery-backed 8K static ram chip, among other smaller components such as resistors, capacitors and diodes. The reason the Shanghai Kid boards die is similar to CPS1 and CPS2 suicide. The battery dies, so the ram chip loses the program code, then the PCB is useless and can't be fixed. There's no ROM or MCU contained in the epoxy block, which was the reason for investigating in the first place.

- Fighting Valda, music resumes after this boss is killed. sharrier536b4gre MC68K

- Keyboard control sometimes sticks ie. the player sprite will either keep on moving after you release the key or freeze solid, to get control back you must press again in the same direction as the last keypress, this happens randomly on any level. sharrier136rc2gre Charvel

- The lives counter doesn't work properly! Sometimes it will either not subtract a lost life or it will actually ADD one or two! I'm still trying to get this nailed right down so I can give you the exact circumstances but it seems to be after you've continued a couple of times and put in two or three credits. sharrier236rc2gre Charvel

- When the highscore table scrolls up at the end of a game the player initials appear behind any game sprites left over on the screen. sharrier336rc2gre Charvel

- When you press END on the highscore table the screen displays some very interesting modern art for about a second then it goes back to normal, it sometimes also does this when you press 1 to start the game. sharrier436rc2gre Charvel

NOTE:

- The only difference between Sheriff and Bandido, beside the copyright notice is the adjustable coinage in Bandido.


WIP:

Correct 8080 CPU1 clock speed to 2016000 Hz, palettesize from 2 to 8 colors, removed prom ($400 - nodump) and replaced 'Unknown' dipswitches with 'Unused'.

- 0.76: Changed Shienryu to IMPERFECT_GFX instead of NOT_WORKING as it seems ok, just the sprites are black.

- 16th October 2003: David Haywood fixed a DMA problem in the SH-2 CPU core that caused broken tile graphics in Shienryu, so Shienryu is now mostly playable although some sprite colors are off.

< Japan >


NOTE:

- You can set the language (Japan, USA, Europe...) in the dipswitch menu


Bugs:

- Game has a country dipswitch. When the switch is set to anything other than Japan the text boxes have garbage displayed in them and the title is garbled. Only the Japanese appears correctly. Only the Japanese title seems to be present in the gfxset. Possibly the other countries each require an alternate ROM for that data. In that case the game would have as many as 7 clones. Update: shippumd37b7gre is for real as Neill Corlett (Yes THE Neill Corlett) has hacked together his own character rom for the USA/Europe Region. Fixing the title screen and characters. Shame it won't be included in MAME. Especially as he hacked it to have the same crc as the original. See http://www.neillcorlett.com/kgpe/. shippumd054ora TriggerFin / Tourniquet

- Shoot The Bull will lock up then reset itself if you spin the trackball backwards when it's your turn. This happens maybe 90% of the times you do it, if it doesn't do it try it a couple more times and it should reset. Error log states "reset caused by the watchdog".

0.37b15 [Aaron Giles]


NOTE:

- May seem impossible to shoot a decent shot. Either the puck stops right after the "1" or the shot is way too hard and the puck flies off the board, making the game unplayable. Not a bug, but a requirement of certain drivers, which may or may not be normal(?). For the longest time I was using default Windows mouse drivers, and was clearly experiencing this "bug". I installed the latest M$ intellimouse drivers, and now the controls work perfectly. So I'd say, at least in my experience, that new intellimouse drivers are a "requirement". Note that I have received reports from others who got the controls working correctly with other drivers. Also note, this "issue" pertains to all trackball games, and that it's always best to set the mouse movement speed to the dead center position in Windows as well as turning off the any acceleration options and then adjust the analog sensitivity via the in-game menu how you like. Also, make sure any frameskipping is turned off. Smitdogg / xtremediver

- Silver Land shouldn't be a clone of River Patrol, it's a totally different game (skiing instead of boat rescue), made by someone else! It's just a cleverly-disguised bootleg. I think it was Zsolt who stated this when the games were first added. It used to be mentioned in one of the text files that came with MAME, but I think it got wiped out once gamelist.txt became automatically generated.- The Dog

0.24 [Marc LaFontaine]


SETUP and TEST MODE:

- The first time you run the game, it will say 'factory settings restored'. Press F2 to proceed.

- Press F2 for Test-Mode

- Press F1 + F2 for Bookkeeping/Setup


NOTE:

- Rows of zeroes appear on the title screen. There were two Sinistar machines at California Extreme, both in perfect working order. One machine displayed a bunch of periods in the same way as all those 0's in MAME, and the other had an actual message displayed there. If you go into diagnostics (hit F2 - Advance) and go through all the tests, you'll end up at the game adjustments screen. Move to the bottom of the list and hit Button 1 (Fire) to select "Yes" for "Set Operator Message". Then hold down the Fire button and hit Advance again, and you'll be taken to the screen where you can set the operator message. Once you're through this screen, the 0's on the title screen will go away. =) However, I noticed one different problem: Once you're out of diagnostics mode AND YOU'VE TOLD IT TO UPDATE THE OPERATOR MESSAGE, it's impossible to play the game! The ship stays in one place and orientation on the screen, rocks appear but don't move on the screen, same thing with any enemy ships that might appear. Firing causes your shots to be displayed OVER the ship. The ship and your shots do not interact with anything on the radar, and some of the radar blips are also stuck. When the Sinistar comes alive, it taunts you and you can see its blip on the radar, but it never appears in the main game area and it can never attack you. The only way out of this is to exit and restart the game. It seems that telling it to adjust the op message causes the game to corrupt something in memory. In order to make any adjustments to the message at all, you HAVE to hold down the Fire button. I don't believe this is how it was meant to work on the real machine (see snapshots). Another update: Removing zeros can work well but you need to press F1+F2 not just F2. If you do that with f2 only, game doesn't work well.


WIP:

- 0.36b7: Aaron Giles rewritten the HC55516 CVSD decoder. This affects Sinistar, Joust 2, Arch Rivals, Pigskin, Tri-Sports, Smash TV, Trog, Narc.

- 0.35b2: Alex Pasadyn emulated speech in Sinistar. Samples are no longer used. Larry Bank and Alex Pasadyn do zhe CVSD emulation, used for speech in Sinistar and in the 34010 games (Smash TV etc.). Add HC55516 sound and remove samples.

- 0.35b1: Nicola Salmoria support analog joystick support in Sinistar and Blaster.

- 0.33b5: Brian Deuel added Sinistar (allegedly from a prototype machine that was displayed at the 1982 AMOA show in Las Vegas).

- 0.31: Howie Cohen added speech in Sinistar, through samples.Aaron Giles and Brad Oliver improved the blitter for the Williams games. Sinistar now works correctly.

- 0.29: Sean Riddle and Pat Lawrence improved the blitter for Sinistar, but there are still some problems. Marc Lafontaine made several fixes to the Williams driver: Sinistar is playable but there are some blitter bugs.

- 0.24: Marc LaFontaine provided drivers for Robotron, Splat, Defender, Joust, Stargate, Bubbles, Blaster and Sinistar. Sinistar do weird things at startup.


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- Blast crystals off planetoids. Pick up crystals to fill bombbay with sinibombs.

- Firing does not affect the mighty SINISTAR. Only sinibombs can affect this nemesis.

- Once the SINISTAR is built you must destroy or you had better run.

- 29th January 2001: Phil Stroffolino sent in the playable Looping driver, with correct graphics and colors, but it lacks one of the nicest features of the game - speech and music. The COP420 microcontroller in fact helps with the CPU communication, so it is probably necessary for sound emulation.

- 28th January 2001: Phil Stroffolino made a big step forward with the Looping driver. While the game is definitely not playable yet (due to the unemulated COP420 microprocessor), at least the title screen shows up.

-  1st November 2000: Phil Stroffolino started on a Looping driver, it runs I/O CPU code fine now but main CPU code does not seem to be valid and the microcontroller isn't emulated, so nothing works.

Bugs:

- When you lose the game, a screen with garbage characters flashes by (game over?) before returning you to attract mode (see snapshot). skysoldr060gre Darkk / Pi

- MAME gives three settings: easy / normal / difficult. However, the game's bootup screen gives a numerical value from 1 to 4. It seems the lower the number, the easier the game. But in MAME 'easy' displays a value of 4 (most difficult), 'normal' displays 3, and 'difficult' displays 2. skysoldr059gra andronova

Bugs:

- slikshot (and clone): When shooting the white cue ball parallel to the scratch line, the game exits to the DOS prompt with a divide by zero fault. This happens to both ROM sets and both DOS MAME and MAMEW. For DOS MAME, error message is: Exiting due to signal SIGFPE Division by Zero at eip=007037d6, x87 status=0020 - For MAMEW, error message is: Exception at EIP=00B1322E: INTEGER DIVIDE BY ZERO Update: The actual arcade machine used cue sticks for controls. Input controls need to be fixed; game abruptly exits if force of cue shot is under the dotted scratch line or runs parallel along the dotted scratch line. slikshot37b15red gregf


WIP:

STORY:

- In the early part of 1950's in the USA. A game called "Violence Fight" was in vogue among Mafia, Reckless Drivers and General Businessmen. The "Violence Fight" was the game to struggle for "No. 1 Quarreler" with fighters who were gathered from all parts of the USA speaking boastingly of their strength. And of course a lot of winning money as well as the honor were given to the "Winner". Here in a downtown in L.A., a young fighter "Bat" and his manager "Blinks" seek for the winning money eagerly. As a matter of fact, can Bat take the No. 1 place of the USA?

0.33b7 [Mirko Buffoni]


Bugs:

- On the bonus levels when you get extra man, all sprites plus most of the playfield disappear. The game returns to normal after time runs out. This happens on both bonus levels; on rare occasion it may occur on other levels as well. Update: Now occurs on normal levels as well (as of .37b15). The glitch also happens when you get 2 point value items simultaneously or quickly one after another. Update: Known so far is that it happens when the player earns an extra life. I've not looked at the source code, but it seems to happen starting on the *second* extra life earned through points upon game start, and then on many later point-earned extra lives. I've not noticed it happen when an extra life is earned due to collecting 10 fairies, or from picking up the "extra life" item (which I've only done twice, damn tough game). When a game is continued after running out of lives, the issue seems to reliably occur on the first point-earned extra life, but later extra lives (until the next continue) don't seem afflicted. solomon36b10yel Chook / B00daW / JHarris

0.36b2 [Ernesto Corvi]


Bugs:

- Stage 4 is played in a forest at night. When the end-level mothership appears, it shows through the trees and scrolls showing through. Its very easy to notice the bug if you play to level 4 (cheats exist). Also, as the mothership appears, the color palette changes. sonofphx36b6gre Fujur

- Clone repulse: Once the player has been shot, a misplaced tile appears on the screen. This does not happen in the other clones. repulse37b7gre Frotz

- Currently, Son of Phenix (sonofphx) is set as parent of Repulse (repulse) and 99 Last War (99lstwar), but sonofphx is bootleg game. Original is repulse or 99lstwar. sonofphx37b6ora Fujix

- 18th June 1999: Ernesto Corvi sent in a preliminary driver for Gyrodine / Son of Phoenix / S.R.D. Mission, but sprites are missing.


STORY:

- In 1980 the Phoenix Empire was defeated and returned to their native Centuri Solar System. Now after many years of planning, the Son Of Phoenix will lead the alien army to destroy earth and avenge the death of his father. You must stand alone to protect everything we believe in, Yuppies, Hamburgers and Mom. Good luck. We know you will be marvelous.

NOTE:

- spacef and clones: No transparency on sprites. The original game is like this as well. Games also are displayed as horizontal when using tweaked modes. The game uses a very unusual screen size (264x232), so there isn't a tweaked mode that's really suitable. Run in a VESA mode for best results.

- Sprite Priority issue -- at start up moon rises in front of the buildings. More: In screens B and C, the INSERT COIN is behind the bumper. Also in these screens, the "Push one player to start" is also being blocked by the bumpers. I have no PCB to test this, but I think its very obvious that those messages should be in front on the bumpers. Tested on 37b16 thru 055. speedbal36b10gre JoJo / Thenasty

- Speedbal is running too fast - I recall the original game: attract mode music has two parts, one before and one after the letters from Speed Ball form the game name. The second part of the music must match the time the letters start flashing. speedbal36b11gre Bugfinder

WIP:

- 0.80: Correct 68000 CPU1 clock speed to 15MHz, TMS32031 CPU2 to 60MHz and added 3x DMA-driven_DAC sound.

- 24th February 2004: Aaron Giles - Fixed a subtle bug in the TMS32031 core that was causing problems with Radikal Bikers. Now at least all the geometry shows up okay. I'm still at a loss to explain alpha blending, Z buffering, or perspective correction. The incomplete driver should be in u2, so if you know some 3D math, feel free to have a look and see if you can't help me figure it out!

- 14th February 2004: Aaron Giles - Still stumped on the perspective correction, but I managed to figure out how the texture masking works so that text no longer has big blocks on the outside. Turns out some of the ROMs provide a 1bpp mask for certain textures. Also, I managed to get Surf Planet up and running. It's on the same hardware, but with a 68000 instead of a 68EC020. If you know MAME, you'll know that it's kind of a pain to do this because you can't just substitute a 68000 directly for a 68EC020 due to different data bus widths. Now if we can just dig up a Speed Up PCB and send it to Guru, I'll have all of the known Gaelco games on this hardware to play with.

- 28th May 2000: Guru - Dumped Speed Up (Gaelco).

STORY:

- A Hildroid is a living organism developed by humans. As submissive as robots, they are used to carry out dangerous tasks instead of humans. Several years later, a nuclear war breaks out for unkown causes. As a result of this war, several shifts in the earth's axis occur and the Hildroids, affected by the radiation, undergo major alterations. They begin to be able to think and move their own will and soon they start to kill their human hosts. It's now several decades later and everthing is as normal at the spcae station for artificial hibernation testing. On board is Captain Waffle who has just woken from his frozen sleep. Meanwhile back on earth, with the alterations in the earth's axis, animals and people appear from the past and become hosts to the Hildroid robots. The Hildroids begin to interfere with the histories of their hosts. Captain Waffle, judging that the next shift in the earth's axis will cause major alterations in history, descends to earth in a one-man escape ship.

- On the arcade machine, at the end of the worm level, the computer takes control of the player and 'walks him' out of the door to the next level, the worms jump at you and bites you, but the player doesn't lose energy. In MAME, he loses energy. splatter061gre3 first

NOTE:

- I crashed on top of a bridge and when the chopper put my car back, it was invisible and I was "trapped" by the vertical track edges as though I was on top of the bridge and horizontal track edges as though I was underneath (see attached screenshots). -Shifty This is not a bug.

-  9th February 1999: Olivier Galibert work on Fire One that has help Star Fire works much better (with trails though). Here is a (real) story what true emulator freaks can do to help preserving old arcade games, and to document the arcade games' history. The fellow who dumped the roms of Fire One had to drive 5 hours (each way) to get the board from a leaky garage which had been used by cats as a litter box. Half of the eproms had corroded pins and the smell was probably very disgusting (Maybe he should mail the board to IDSA *evil grin* - http://www.idsa.org/. He got the roms dumped, and then the newest addition to MAME team, Olivier Galibert, started furiously working on the game. As a nice side effect, Star Fire also works much better (with trails though). Still no sound in either of these games, and it seems very unlikely that the samples could be extracted from that non-functioning board...

0.27 [Steve Baines, Frank Palazzolo, Brad Oliver, Bernd Wiebelt]


WIP:

- 0.80u2: Reverted some Star Wars code back to older working version in machine\starwars.c, this fixes bad trench vectors in Star Wars.

- 0.79: Aaron Giles fixed a problem with Star Wars.

- 0.72: Frank Palazzolo removed "bad trench vectors hack" from Star Wars which he created in 1997. Appears not to be necessary any more.

- 0.58: Correct palettesize from 256 to 32768 colors.

- 0.53: Move the cpu1 roms ($0, $400, $800, $c00) to Mathbox proms.

- 0.35b11: Brad Oliver added Star Wars (rev 2).

- 18th April 1999: Brad Oliver added another Star Wars romset.

- 0.30: Frank Palazzolo added a TI TMS5220 emulator. This handles speech in Star Wars and other games. Bernd Wiebelt made fixes to Star Wars brightness.

- 0.29: Aaron Giles did some optimizations to the 6809, and modified it to always fetch opcodes directly from RAM (much faster). The Ghosts 'n Goblins, Star Wars and Williams drivers needed reworking to support that. And made some fixes to the Star Wars mathbox.

- 0.28: John Butler provided a new 6809 emulator. It is faster than the previous one, and fixes some bugs including the ship moving in the wrong direction on the tower level of Star Wars and the bonus maze in Pac & Pal. Steve Baines fixed color intensities in Star Wars - objects now fade out properly. You might find it a bit too dark now, but this is done to reproduce the differences in brightness that the original has. Frank Palazzolo fixed the 'bad trench vectors' and 'fail to approach Death Star' bugs in Star Wars.

- 0.27: Steve Baines, with the help of Frank Palazzolo and Brad Oliver, implemented Star Wars. It's playable, but far from perfect. There's even some preliminary sound support (slows the game down a lot).


STORY:

- Obi-Wan Kenobi is gone but his presence is felt within the force. The Empire's Death Star, under the command of Darth Vader, nears the rebel planet. You must join the rebellion to stop the Empire. The force will be with you - Always.


FLIGHT INSTRUCTIONS to Red Five:

- Your X-Wing is equipped with an invisible deflector shield that will protect you for 6 collisions.

- Deflector strength is lost when a fireball impacts your shield or when you strike a Laser Tower or Trench Catwalk.

- Aim your lasers with cursor to explode Empire Tie Fighters, Laser Tower tops and Trench Turrets.

- Shoot fireballs before they impact your shield.

- The Rebel Force is depending on you to stop the Empire by blowing up the Death Star.

NOTE:

- On level three (the tank stage) of Strategy X, you can't see the shots of the enemy tanks. Your shots and the explosions, however, are still visible. In Part "BASE" (level 5) of the game, where you have to go against Immortalian, the shots and explosions of those shots of the enemy turrets are invisible (the same effect as the tank bug). Note: This can be seen also on the original arcade version. Not a MAME bug.

0.31 [Paul Leaman]


NOTE:

- In service mode the unused 3rd start button is positioned to on. It should be off. To test it, I did the following: 1) Pressed f2 enter service mode (it didn't go into service mode w/out resetting), 2) Pressed f3 to reset the machine (now it's in service mode), 3) Looked at the inputs screen - start 3 was set to ON like the bug description says, 4) Pressed f2 - start 3 toggles to off, 5) Pressed f2 - start 3 toggles to on and 5) Pressed f2 - start 3 toggles to off (and so forth). Therefore, it appears that the test mode's start 3 button (unused in the actual game) serves as the game's service mode button. When I enter service mode using the dip switch instead of f2 and look at the input screen, start 3 is set to off as it should be. Therefore the initial pressing of f2 to get into test mode is what toggled start 3 to on. I don't know how the actual machine worked, but it makes sense that this wouldn't be a bug. jerryjanis


Bugs:

- If you look closely at the world in the background in the final-boss scene, you can see that the bottom-right piece of the world is a little too far to the left. strider056gre1 Jonemaan

- A little black block is seen above the character in some animation frames when you walk up a steepest hill, this happens when walking left, right, or upside-down. strider056gre2 Jonemaan

Also included was a preliminary Race Drivin' driver, which unfortunately goes weird as soon as the simulation begins.

- 11th August 2000: Aaron Giles fixed the missing status bar in S.T.U.N. Runner.

- 10th August 2000: Aaron Giles did some brilliant work and finally got the polygon graphics working in the preliminary Hard Drivin' / S.T.U.N. Runner driver, which requires about 2 GHz to run properly.

0.34b2 [Mike Balfour]


TODO:

* Complete discrete sound

* Add Overlay


NOTE:

- This game uses two monitors, one for each player, aimed away from each other. The emulation displays both monitors side by side on the screen. A lot of the challenge is lost when you can see both monitors. Unfortunately, there is no other simple solution to allow 2-player support on a single-monitor computer. Also, Subs is mildly dependent on its overlay. Without the overlay, it might not be obvious that the playfield is circular in shape, and the blinking white box actually illuminates a box labelled 'Sonar'.


WIP:

- 0.69: Derrick Renaud added preliminary discrete sound (driver still needs Sonar Sounds to be done).

- 0.26a: Super Pac Man and Mappy have correct pitch now (thanks Aaron and Satoh). Also, SuperPac has speed cheat control again.

- 0.26: Aaron Giles added sound support to Super Pac Man.

- 0.21: Thanks to Dark Schneider (DS wanted to be anonymous, so I'll call him this way) that provided 6809 support and the first driver working on this CPU: Super Pac Man. The driver is based on the super-detailed KEG file of Replay emulator by Kevin Brisley.

0.78 [Norbert Kehrer]


NOTE:

- The Game Super Tank: The arcade game "Super Tank" was made in 1981 by the German company Video Games GmbH. It is a shooter where you control a tank and have to clear a field of mines and bushes. You are chased by enemy tanks, which fire at you. After wiping out all the mines and bushes, you reach the second level. It is kind of a "boss" level, where you have to fight a big enemy tank, the Super Tank. You can destroy it by a direct hit into its gun. As far as I know, Super Tank was sold in Germany, Austria, and other European countries, and it was licensed to the company Computran for distribution in the US market. I would be interested in more background information on the companies Video Games GmbH (they were located in the town of Lich in Germany) and Computran. I would also like to know, in which other countries Super Tank machines were in the arcades. If you know something about this, please email to norbert.kehrer@utanet.at. 

- The MAME Driver for Super Tank: Norbert Kehrer finished his first and preliminary version of a MAME driver for Super Tank. It was very hard work to figure out, how all the hardware works. This reverse-engineering process took him many days. He had practically no information about the hardware, no schematics, and not even a memory map. He ended up in writing my own stand-alone emulator for the game to do my testing, before he could convert it to MAME. Now, after he finally found out, how the video hardware really works, he see, that compared to other machines it is rather simple! After he knew, how most of the things in Super Tank worked, it was really easy to make the MAME driver. Well, "coding" is the wrong word.


WIP:

- 18th December 2003: Norbert Kehrer fixed another DIP switch bug in the Super Tank driver.

- 16th December 2003: Pierpaolo Prazzoli fixed the DIP switches and added two unknown PROMs to the Super Tank driver.

- 15th December 2003: Norbert Kehrer submitted a fully working driver for Super Tank.

0.81u4 [Aaron Giles]


WIP:

-  6th April 2004: Aaron Giles sent in a driver for Super Rider which works fully except some sound effects might not be emulated yet.

-  4th April 2004: Aaron Giles - I'm a bit held up on Super Rider as I'm trying to find a good frequency counter that will count up to 10MHz. I took a gamble at Fry's and picked up a cheapie that claimed to be able to go that high, but not suprisingly, it was just a figment of someone's imagination. It also turns out that Super Rider has some discrete sound components on the board. I don't know how likely it is I can trace out the circuit that generates the sound, but it's just one sound I think (the rest is a pair of standard AY-8910s).

- 22th March 2004: Aaron Giles - Snicker all you want at the techniques and my low-rent ROM reading equipment, but it gets the job done. One of the epoxy ROMs was 100% good, one was 50% good, and the third was pretty much garbage. There are still some weird behaviors, but the game feels half- finished, so I might actually chalk it up to quirkiness of the game. I've verified checksums across all the epoxy ROMs and am confident the data is valid at this point.

- 21th March 2004: Aaron Giles - Okay, so the trojan was written, I went to burn it onto a ROM and discovered to my great disappointment that my ROM burning computer had bitten the dust. Most likely a power supply problem, but I'd hated that crap computer for quite a while now. The big problem with replacing the ROM burning computer is that my ROM programmer and my GAL/PAL programmer both are ISA devices. Since nobody makes modern computers with ISA buses, I asked a coworker to help me find a local used/recycled computer shop, and picked up a loaded P2-400 with two ISA slots for $90. Assembled the new computer yesterday, burned the ROMs, and success! The trojan displays 256 bytes of data from the epoxy-protected ROMs. Which 256-byte area is selected via the DIP switch on the main board. I have 48 pictures just like this one to hand-verify, but when I'm done, we should finally have a good dump of Super Rider!

- 19th March 2004: Aaron Giles - Inspired by the arrival of a second Super Rider PCB last night (thanks to the guy who donated it!), I tried to actually get one of my two boards to come up in my JAMMA harness. Now, I'm not much with a soldering iron, but I did manage to wire up the GND, +5V and +12V connections, as well as the video ground, sync, and red, green, blue connections. First attempt didn't work, reporting a bad VRAM. Since VRAM was on the lower board, I swapped out that board with the lower board from the other set, flipped the switch, and got it up and running! With a working board set, I can now set about to write a trojan that will dump the missing 12k of ROM that is encased in an epoxy block from hell. In the meantime, I spent some time last night trying to figure out the color scheme, and made some good progress. The background and sprites have correct colors in this screenshot (yes, the colors are gaudy ... it's one of the appeals of the original game.)

-  7th January 2003: Aaron Giles - Got Super Rider up and running with sprites and sound, but there are some missing ROMs (embedded in an epoxy block on the PCB ?).

TODO:

* Complete 3D hardware emulation


WIP:

- 0.80: Aaron Giles made various Gaelco3D improvements, so Radikal Bikers and Surf Planet are fully playable now. Correct 68000 CPU1 clock speed to 15MHz, TMS32031 CPU2 to 60MHz and added 3x DMA-driven_DAC sound.

-  2nd March 2004: Aaron Giles - After getting Radikal Bikers working well, I decided to figure out what was up with Surf Planet. Turns out they were relying on unspecified behavior of the TMS32031 by placing a CALL statement at the end of a repeat block. They tell you several times in the docs for the CPU never to do this, but hey, I guess if it works more power to them. With that fixed and some rendering tweaks, I'm currently getting about 30-50% of full speed on my 3GHz machine. If I turn off bilinear filtering and run at half resolution, both games are playable near 100%. Of course, I don't have the sound working yet, and that will kill the speed nicely (it's a DCS-like ADSP chip, sorry!)

- 24th February 2004: Aaron Giles - Fixed a subtle bug in the TMS32031 core that was causing problems with Radikal Bikers. Now at least all the geometry shows up okay. I'm still at a loss to explain alpha blending, Z buffering, or perspective correction. The incomplete driver should be in u2, so if you know some 3D math, feel free to have a look and see if you can't help me figure it out!

- 22nd February 2000: Vernon C. Brooks added Suzuka 8 Hours 2 to the Namco System 2 driver, but like the other racing games, it's unplayable. Guru - Fixed the Char layer and now it looks much better. Still no title or bike gfx.

- 21st February 2000: Guru - I added Suzuka 8 Hours 2 to the source but it won't get past the test mode. Vernon C. Brooks fixed some protection issues and now Suzuka 8 Hours 2 comes up, though it is far from working. No Title gfx, no bike gfx, no controls (like most of the non-working System 2 games). As well as that the roadway code is not implimented yet in all the system 2 driving/racing games. It's a start though...

Possible Bugs:

- Clone svolleyk: In volleyball arcade machine (video systems 1989, Korean set), appears red arrows indicating the position to receive the ball, the arrows appears in the first tournament, so when play second championship (vs. USA and then vs. URSS) no appears, so is more difficult to receive the ball. I dont know the origional machine, so I dont know if the arrows are meant to not be there, but not having them there after the first match makes the game VERY difficult, so I imagine they really must be meant to be there. svolleyk37b11gre Sixtoe

- 0.35b2: Juergen Buchmueller should REALLY be fixed this time the hang in Tapper

- 0.34: Juergen Buchmueller fixed bug in the Z80 emulator which caused crashes in Tapper and Tron.

Samples required


NOTE:

- There are two keys for each coin 1 and coin 2. In addition, it seems coin 2 doesn't work. This is actually required for operation. When I tried separating the coin 1 and 2 mappings, I found that if pressing one coin froze the game, pressing the other caused coin entry. In other words, clearly both switches need to be activated simultaneously for correct operation. El Condor

David Haywood fixed flickering sprites in Metamorphic Force, graphics layer offsets in several games in both the Mystic Warriors and Konami System GX drivers. Acho A.

NOTE:

- Several people complained that mouse control is reversed. This is not the case. The more obvious place where this can be seen is the level selection screen at the beginning: move the mouse right, the block goes right. Anyway, if you don't like the key assignments, you can change them.


DIP/Input Bugs:

- There are no seperate controls for player2 in cocktail mode. tempest054gra BSR


WIP:

- 0.75: Added clone Tempest (rev ?).

-  7th October 2003: Aaron Giles added another set of Tempest.

- 0.72: Frank Palazzolo moved flipping and swapping API stuff from vector.c to avgdvg.c, this is specific to tempest and quantum only.

- 0.58: Correct palettesize from 33024 to 32768 colors.

- 30th January 2002: Aaron Giles added better vector sparkle effect emulation as used in Major Havoc and Tempest.

- 0.37b14: Correct vector orientation to vertical.

-  5th April 2001: Nicola Salmoria fixed Tempest and Quantum screen orientation and added screen flip / rotate support to the vector routines, but the changes are not yet complete.

- 0.37b7: Juergen Buchmueller fixed the Pokey emulation so that the Tempest reset bug is fixed, this time for real and forever.

- 28th August 2000: Juergen Buchmueller modified the Pokey RNG functions to finally work as they would in real hardware.

-  7th August 2000: KBD fixed, hopefully finally, the Tempest 150k reset bug.

- 25th June 2000: Juergen Buchmueller fixed the Pokey sound core, and Tempest sounds a bit better now.

- 0.36RC2: Correct M6502 CPU1 and the 2x Pokey clock speed to 1512000 Hz.

-  4th March 2000: Juergen Buchmuelller tweaked Tempest again to work better.

-  5th February 2000: Juergen Buchmueller rewrote the Pokey code and made some speedups to the Pokey core.

- 15th December 1999: Juergen Buchmueller hopefully fixed the Tempest reset bug. The hangs in Tempest caused by the Pokey protection.

- 0.33b7: Darrin Redick added Tempest version 2 and 3. Bernd Wiebelt was inspired by Retrocade and Vector Dream, changed the vector games to use translucent vectors. Color intensities had to be lowered, if it feels to dark for you now, increase the gamma correction value.

- 0.30: Brad Oliver code emulation of AVG sparkling bit (Tempest stars/fireworks).

- 0.29: Brad Oliver updated pokyintf.c source to be more like 8910intf.c. Variable clock frequency, port callbacks, a clipping parameter, variable updates per frame. Most noticeably, Tempest has much improved sound with more frequent updates. Keith Gerdes make new fix to avoid lockup in Tempest after 150,000 points - this one should really work.

- 0.28: Sean Trowbridge found a workaround to make Tempest not lock up at 150,000 points.

- 0.27: Brad Oliver and Bernd Wiebelt fixed Tempest, no longer crash after level 13, has better colors (colorram emulation) and is overall a bit faster. Thanks to the precious information on the Pokey random number generator provided by Eric Smith, Hedley Rainnie and Sean Trowbridge, some problems with Centipede (start with 18 credits) and Tempest (hang after level 13) are now solved. Trackball support for Tempest and Red Baron. Bernd Wiebelt sincerely hopes he fixed the BCD-emulation in the 6502 emulation. At least the authentic Tempest feeling (broken X/Y monitor) is gone, since the game now starts without pressing Fire.

- 0.26a: Thanks to Al Kossow, Hedley Rainnie and Eric Smith for the code to their vecsim emulator which had emulated these games previously on the unix and the mac, and thanks to Neil Bradley for pointing out the critical bug in the vector generator engine which prevented Tempest from working.

- 0.26: MAME entered in vectorial emulation world. All in a time, we have support for Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Black Widow, Battlezone, Gravitar, Lunar Lander, Red Baron, Spaceduel and Tempest.

Bugs:

- Side-by-side pcb test: movie sequences: The Cyberdyne Systems sign displays correctly on the pcb. Also in the previous sequence with the 3 cut scenes the center scene (motorcycle & frieghtliner grill) is definately reversed, I couldn't notice if the other 2 were. I'm going to have to install a pause switch on my board :) missing light effects/explosion artwork: The mirror that reflects the screen to you has explosions on the back. 1 on the left and 1 on the right. When you take damage it lights up a bulb behind the mirror and you see a translucent red and white explosion over the screen. The outputs aren't in the driver to run it though. I guess I can't scan it but I might be able to backlight it and photograph it sometime (if anyone is willing to work on the driver changes).

- At the end of thunderl, there's a message written in a near-illegible font that seems to not be used anywhere else in the game (that I noticed). I found this font in F4 (page down). In this image, the black background stuff is from the gfxset, the blue stuff is lifted from the ending screenshot, the black text is a guess at what it says. This is obviously wrong... thunderl055ora TriggerFin

0.34b4 [Nicola Salmoria]


NOTE:

- The MCU protection in Tiger Heli is very simple. It compares for a value to return a specific number, otherwise it will give the BAD HW message(stored at locations $10AB-$10B5). The program itself says what kind of value is needed (usually,but not always 0x83).This is simulated by reading what value the main program asks,then adjusting it to the value really needed (as it was managed by a real MCU). The bootlegs patches this with different ways: The first one patches the final 'ret z' opcode check with a 'ret' at 10AAh. The second one patches the e803 checks with a 'ret' at location 109Dh.


DIP/Input Bugs:

- Clone tigerhb1: When the "Bonus Life" Dip Switch is set to "20000 80000" (which is what you can read in the "test mode"), you in fact CAN'T get ANY extra life (even when collecting 10 "diamonds"!) due to code at 0x1082 (see text file). tigerhb1061gra stephh

0.77 [Aaron Giles]

TODO:

* Full Protection


WIP:

- 0.77: Added audio TMS32031 CPU2 (33868800Hz) and Custom stereo sound. Change joy8way to stick - status good now!

- 11th November 2003: Aaron Giles sent in an update to the Atari GT driver with fixed graphics in the T-Mek prototype version, though sound doesn't work in it. Aaron Giles (WIP) - I was able to get going was some progress on T-Mek. It turns out that the prototype version we've had sitting there for a long time actually has no protection. What it really needed was a fix for the video side of things, and I think I've managed to get that right. Unfortunately, the sound ROMs for the prototype version are not correct, so although sounds play, they are not the right sounds. In addition, I was able to get the "official" version of the game closer to working, though some of the graphics are incorrect due to unemulated protection. The final upshot of all this is that you will have two options: you can either play the prototype version, which has correct graphics and gameplay, but plays the wrong sound effects. Or you can play the official version, which has bad graphics, but seems to play okay and has the correct sound effects. Neither is perfect, but it's the closest yet to T-Mek emulation, so it will have to do for now!

- 0.74u2: Added T-MEK and clone (prototype).

Bugs:

- In the sewer level when there are foot soldiers jumping out at you out of the water, they start out white, only to turn purple as they get out. They should be purple the whole time (never white) (see snapshots). tmnt062gre NeoGouki

- tmht, tmht2p: These games should play a different sample in the attract mode, replacing 'ninja' with 'hero'. These games are currently calling their sound ROMs from the parent, and likely need to be dumped. tmht061gre El Condor

- tmnt.c tmnt: UPD7759 - When you start a game for the first time, the "Fire!" sample clicks - not badly, but noticeably - at the beginning. If you reset the game (by pressing F3) and start it again, it sounds normal. tmnt074gre Santeri Saarimaa

0.31 [Chris Moore]


NOTE:

- The story of TNZS2 isn't exactly known. Most of the console/computer ports of TNZS had levels identical to TNZS, but surprisingly the Genesis TNZS is identical to TNZS2.


Bugs:

- It still has the old bug: sometimes it hangs up in the 3-2 level. In the same level you can see some graphic glitches: the cannon ball shot by the sheep (?) does an explosion but it remains still. This bug is also in the older, harder version (tnzs2 with the old Taito logo). You'll see the sheep scientist with the cannon near a whole lot of other enemies near the end of level 1-4 in this version. When the sheep fires the cannon, TNZS either freezes, gives some garbage graphics, or resets and gives a "BAD HARDWARE" message. Update (MAME .66) : The graphic glitches are still there, but the crash doesn't happen anymore. tnzs36b16yel The tECHIDNA / Maccy

- 27th October 1999: Quench fixed a sound crash in TNZS.

- 0.35b7: Nicola Salmoria added clone The NewZealand Story (World, bootleg). Correct Z80 CPU1 clock speed to 6MHz and YM2203 to 3MHz.

- 16th March 1999: Brad Oliver and Nicola Salmoria have worked on TNZS, trying to fix crashes and adding a bootleg.

0.31 [Jarek Parchanski]


NOTE:

- Toki (Bootleg) has a dip marked "cocktail" or "upright" defining cab type. The "cocktail" mode doesn't work. This bootleg PCB didn't support cocktail mode as far as we know, it was "sacrificed" during the bootlegging, it is correct to have it labeled as such since it still shows up during the self-check.


Bugs:

- toki, tokia, tokiu: The Toki logo on the title screen is completely messed up; the raster effects start halfway down the logo, and it flickers horribly. toki071u2gre BMF54123

- Clone tokiu: "0000000" is always displayed as the top hiscore during gameplay, regardless of what it actually is. This does not happen in the other Toki sets. tokiu056gre zaxxon1

Correct 68000 CPU1 clock speed to 10MHz, audio Z80 and YM3812 to 3579545 Hz and OKI6295 to 8000 Hz. Remove MSM5205 sound support. Correct graphics resolution to 256x240.

WIP:

- 0.36b7: Aaron Giles fixed Turkey Shoot.

-  9th March 1999: Michael Soderstrom has finally sent in the newest Williams driver with added support for Mystic Marathon, Turkey Shoot, Inferno and Joust 2.


STORY:

- The year is 1989, one year after the great gobble blight which plagued the wolrd. One third of earth's populace was transformed into turkeys by the ailment. The side effect of turkey transformation is a tendency toward violence and comradery between these turkeys to organize for rabble-rousing in the urban areas. In February of '89, a group of specially trained agents (the Turkey Terminators) was formed for the sole task of destroying the turkey menace. As a terminator, you must be mentally and physically prepared for a series of missions complimentary to your skills. Good luck and strength to you!


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:

- As a Turkey Terminator, you will be given 100 missions. All turkeys must be eliminated to succeed.

- A mission is "fouled up" if a turkey escapes, or any innocent bystander is damaged. You are allowed 3 foul ups.

- Protect these people: 'blue' man, woman and police

- Presenting the villains: The thug turkey (500 pts), the pilot turkey (500), the boss turkey, the cyborg-mechanoturkey

- Sight your enemy and shoot! Lauch a grenade when lit. Gobble button may be used only once per mission. Take careful aim if a hostage is taken.

WIP:

-  9th March 2004: Aaron Giles - I've been talking to Derrick Renaud about the discrete sound system and how I can start getting involved. What I would really like to do is get full sound simulation in Turbo, but that will require some op-amp primitives that Derrick is working on. I did manage to get a start on it by doing the square wave beep sounds, but that's just a tiny bit of the overall mess. I'm added also n-channel sound support (Turbo requires 4 output channels).

- 0.63: Subroc-3D, Turbo and Buck Rogers use the artwork to show the LED counters. Correct graphics resolution to 208x248, palettesize to 512 colors and aspect ratio to 3:4.

Bugs:

- I seem to remember on the original arcade game of Tutankham that when you shoot, if any part of your shot hits an enemy (including the trail of the shot), it dies. But in MAME, it only kills when the head of the shot hits the enemy. Am I remembering this correctly? Update: this has been checked against a real board and confirmed to be a bug. tutankhm37b10gre Chad H


WIP:

- 0.25: Mirko Buffoni added Tutankham. Moose provided him a good bunch of information and he lost much time on a stupid bug in bank selection. Thanks to David Dahl (techt@juno.com) that provided him a driver too, and he found the light!! Also thanks to Rob Jarrett for the exhaustive memory map (He included it in sources, it's better than his).

Note:

- If you start a game and you can chose "Beginner Mode" and you hit the button, the tennis ball changes from yellow to soem wrong looking red. Happens on the real PCB (sitting 5 feet away on my shelf :-) Aaron Giles

TODO:

* Locks up when you attempt to start a game

* Missing BG graphics in level select screen


WIP:

- 0.82u2: Aaron Giles fixed missing truncation on vertex coordinates (fixes vaportrx graphics), formalized support for the "widget" board used in vaportrx & calspeed, marked sfrush and vaportrx as working, added more extensive documentation on the various boardsets, constants for the GT64010 and all interrupts and ethernet device interrupt support. Made the IDE controller visible on the PCI bus, hooked up CMOS protection bit and corrected sfrushrk audio CRCs and hooked up hard disk.

- 14th May 2004: Aaron Giles - The ethernet controller was the missing link in San Francisco Rush, which is now playable. On the plus side, it turns out that a missing ethernet controller was also the cause of Vapor TRX not working as well, so now that is playable. By the way, a number of people were wondering why the Vapor TRX CHD is so big. Well, it turns out that the entire attract mode is pre-rendered movies, which explains a lot!

- 0.81u5: Aaron Giles added shuffle map and optional R/B component swapping for Vapor TRX.

- 14th April 2004: Aaron Giles sent in an update to the Atari Seattle driver, adding Vapor TRX (resets when trying to start a game) and fixing various other issues in the driver and in the Voodoo graphics emulation.

NOTE:

- The vball gfx roms comes from the Japan bootleg version. The original has the image data stored in a special dip rom which has not been dumped.


Bugs:

- The timing is too slow, the players, etc. move incredibly slow, which is strange because the clocks were corrected based on Guru's board. vball071u1gre pomata / Haze / Karasu


WIP:

- 0.77u3: Jarek Burczynski updated Vball (Japan) to use graphics extracted from origianl PCB.

-  4th December 2003: Jarek Burczynski fixed the ROM names and background data in U.S. Championship V'ball (Japan).

- 12th September 2003: Guru - Finally completed the adapter to read the nasty Toshiba embedded ROM on US Championship V'Ball. Still some work to do though, it's not quite giving us the correct read yet... it's taken Jarek and I many hours over several months to get to this point, we're not far off now!

- 0.69u3: Guru corrected various clocks in the vball driver. Correct M6502 CPU1 clock speed to 2MHz and MSM6295 to 8000 Hz.

- 15th May 2003: Guru - US Championship V'Ball (Technos 1988) arrived from Karasu Tojo in Japan.

- 0.67: Correct graphics resolution to 240x240, scrolling, background tiles and dipswitches.

-  4th April 2003: Steve Ellenoff submitted various graphics emulation improvements to the U.S. Championship V'ball driver.

SETUP:

- Press F10 to speed up game DIAGNOSTIC TEST.


Bugs:

- victory and victorba: When you are in the emulation and you reset the game, the POST reports an audio error (though sound still seems to work normally). victory137b4gre The tECHIDNA

- victory and victorba: About 60% of the time, when you use the shield, the speech and sound gets garbled/corrupted, then all sound is cut off until you die. victory237b4gre The tECHIDNA

- Several betas ago (i think b12 was the last I played it on), Victory and it's clone would fail the unit test the first time you ran it, and then after that it would pass it everytime (except on a reset, but that bug is already verified). for the past few betas (b15 is when I first noticed) it fails the unit test everytime. victory37b16gre Karasu

0.81u1 [Olivier Galibert]


NOTE:

- This early polygon game was based on System 32, with a NEC v60 RISC processor and FPU 32bits 16M flops coprocessor. Sound was based on a MC68000 10 MHz and unknown sound chip.


WIP:

- 27th April 2004: Guru - Received a huge pile of Model 1 boards including several Virtua Racing PCBs and a Virtua Fighter PCB from Justin Dawkins.

- 0.81u6: R. Belmont added full sound and music to the Model 1 driver. Changed sound1 rom ($200000) to sound2. Added 68000 (12MHz) CPU2, YM3438 (8MHz) and 2x Sega_315-5560 MultiPCM stereo sound.

-  2nd April 2004: Olivier Galibert submitted a very preliminary Sega Model 1 driver that supports Virtua Racing, Virtua Fighter, Star Wars Arcade and Wing War, though none of them are playable, none of them have sound emulation and they still have major graphics glitches.

Bugs:

- There is an area (it's a little while after the boat goes diagonally) that no matter if you run into a rock or not, you always fall off the board. I also noticed that this happens when (in the same area) a red-colored version of the speedboat comes onto the screen. You can see the latter if you jump (but you will still fall off the board when you land). Therefore, it is impossible to finish the first level (you keep falling off the board and get penalized until the time reaches 0). waterski37b5yel The tECHIDNA


Possible Bugs:

- Some graphics in this game appear corrupted, likely due to bad dumps or bitrot. Example A / Example B Update: Since waterski uses the same fonts as alpine, I made this graphic to illustrate which characters are clearly bad. I was able to narrow it down to three characters. See the graphic here. waterski055gre BSR

Bugs:

- Clone wc90b: Has video problems - check the snapshots, some players are cut at left and bottom of the screen - this has always been this way, could it be a badly programmed bootleg? Update: Also affects wc90. wc90b36b11gre Bugfinder / mach

- Clone wc90b: Sometimes all the sprites begin to blink even if they aren't under player control. wc90b37b3gre cortez

- Clone wc90b: Scrolling is jerky and slow. Specifically, it seems that it doesn't refresh properly. Main set and other clones are unaffected (mainly because they are on another driver...) wc90b056gre_1 Kale

- Clone wc90b: On the Credit display screen, the PCB shows the upper part of the stadium. In 0.56 the game shows the midfield. Only this clone is affected. wc90b056gre_2 Kale

0.60 [Aaron Giles]


NOTE:

- wcbowl, wcbwl161, wcbwl165: The WCB 1.6x versions fail the GROM test in service mode. The 1.2 version tests fine. This is not (exactly) a bug, it's due to the lack of emulation (due to internal ROM code) of the PIC chip that's used for protection. The checksum routine interacts with the PIC. I know, I burned a set of the ROMs and checked them on a real board and they pass. Plus, the little green LED for the PIC chip stays lit the whole time the checksum is running. Brian A. Troha

Samples required


TODO:

* Emulate Votrax SC-01 speech synthesizer


NOTE:

- The original machine had a special joystick which could be moved either partially or fully in a direction. Pushing it slightly would turn around the player without making it move. The emulator assumes that you are always pushing the joystick fully, to simulate the 'half press' you can press Alt.

- 0.36b7: Added Custom sound.

- 0.33b4: Alex Judd supports word samples in Wizard of Wor. Only 70% of the needed samples are available, however.

- 0.16: Fixed a couple of remaining graphic glitches in the Wizard of Wor driver.

- 0.15: Thanks to the invaluable help of Steve Scavone, Nicola have been able to fix many bugs in the Wizard of Wor driver.

- 0.06: Nicola is beginning to understand how the Wizard of Wor video hardware works, gameplay hasn't changed but the graphics are more faithfully reproduced.

- 0.05: Fixed some problems in the Wizard of Wor driver, but it is still far from complete.

- 0.04: Early Wizard of Wor support (not playable).

- After a couple passes through the demo mode, the background on the qsound screen will go to a shade of green. This shade of green then appears on every screen transition which should be black. Have not seen this behaviour in any other cps2 game. xmcota056gre john_iv

0.35b13 [Nicola Salmoria]

0.33b1 [Carlos A. Lozano]


Bugs:

- The game is a bit too fast. For example: the intro music (the one with the space ship and the planet far away) should be in sync with what happens on screen: the fifth loud note should be in sync with the ship going away into the planet; and the music must stop when your character get out of the ship (on some planet, like the green one, the music is even stopped by the level music starting). On the green planet, the mid boss, the dinosaur move and fire too fast: its neck movements should be more 'snake like'. The game is generally too hard because it's too fast: a good player should be able to avoid every bullets (even the dinosaur ones) and finish any first stages without being touched, but because it's too fast, and that there are too many things happening at the same time, it's impossible (all those things happening at the same time could be taken care of if the game was slower). I have finished this game in the arcade with only one credit. xsleena070u5gre Y.M.I


Possible Bugs:

- On the first stage (the brown moon-like planet), around 1/3 through the stage, there is a large gap with rock and metal platforms floating. On the last metal platform, there is an enemy that gives a weapon power up if killed. If you don't kill him, and then you let him get away, he will walk away floating in the air. I don't remember seeing that on the real arcade machine. I think he should fall when he walks over the edge. The power up enemy should really jump the edge of the platform (like I remembered), but as you can see, it thinks that it's farther (see inp file). xsleena070u5gre2 Y.M.I

- There appears to be a small line of graphics missing on a couple of characters. When on the green planet (Lagto Soa), the sea dragon is missing a line near it's rear and then a bit later on that level when you fight the boss, after you've destroyed his Robocop-like suit, when he jumps around in the air, sometimes there is a line missing on his head. xsleena059gre Smitdogg

Bugs:

- There's an odd problem with the bonus game as shown in the following snapshots. In the first shot, count the number of offensive players. There are only 6 including the quarterback. The next shot shows 2 more players, that only become visible when the defensive players run into them (see snapshots and inp file). Update: When any of the players are running diagonally, a football will appear to be in their hand for one frame of animation. In the following shot, you can see five players in addition to the ball handler with footballs (see snapshot). yard37b4gre Frotz / BSR

TEST MODE:

- Use F2 to enter test mode, then 1 to advance from one test to the following.


NOTE:

- In Zaxxon, after you enter your initials, the screen proudly displays: INITIALS ENTERD Happens on the real machine...


Bugs:

- "Zaxxon" side-by-side test (read report). zaxxon37b8ora Gary Walton


WIP:

- 0.76u1: Correct Z80 CPU1 clock speed to 3041250 Hz.

- 23rd October 2003: Converted Zaxxon to use tilemaps in the foreground graphics layer, and corrected the CPU speed in it.

- 0.35: Added clone Jackson.

- 0.33b5: John Butler support rotation in Zaxxon.

- [Zaxxon/Super Zaxxon Sound Samples: By an anonymous individual. 11/20/98 Zaxxon uses discrete sound circuitry that cannot be emulated. I got lucky and found some sound boards that still had some power in them. Most Zaxxon boards the capacitors are all dried up so a lot of the sound disappear. Stuff to do: Zaxxon has 5 flight sound variations. These have to be put into the driver to take advantage of them.]

- 0.31: Alex Judd support sample sound in Zaxxon and Berzerk. Gerald Vanderick added accurate colors.

- 0.30: A note about Zaxxon colors: we are aware that they are wrong. The reason is that we are using the Super Zaxxon color PROM. As soon as we'll have the correct Zaxxon color PROM, they will be fixed.

- 0.29: Zaxxon is getting there (sprites are mostly correct, background isn't).

- 0.28: Zaxxon and Congo Bongo can go in service mode (F2).

- 0.09: Background graphics in Zaxxon now work, albeit a bit slow (45-50 fps on my 486/100)

- 0.081: Zaxxon now works, but the background graphics are missing.

NOTE:

- At location 0xD50A is what looks like an undocumented opcode. I tried implementing it given what opcode 0x23 should do, but it still didn't work in demo mode. So this could be another protection or a bad ROM read. I'm NOPing it out for now. Zsolt Vasvari

NOTES:

- The Amazing Maze Game" on title screen, but manual, flyer, cabinet side art all call it just "Amazing Maze"

- Desert Gun was originally named Road Runner. The name was changed when Midway merged with Bally who had a game by the same title.

- Space Invaders Deluxe still says Space Invaders Part II, because according to KLOV, Midway was only allowed to make minor modifications of the Taito code.

- Games confirmed not use an overlay (pure black and white): 4 Player Bowling


SOUND HARDWARE NOTES:

- Author of the sound routines for the 'invaders' games are Tormod Tjaberg

- The samples were taken from Michael Strutt's excellent space invader emulator and converted to signed samples so they would work under SEAL. The port info was also gleaned from his emulator. These sounds should also work on all the invader games.


Bugs:

- sicv, sisv, sisv2: With artwork enabled, the shields are not displaying and the firing of aliens and ship are screwed up (they hit the "invisible" shields). However if -noartwork is appllied, the game is ok. Only the CV and SV versions of Space Invaders with the original /artwork/invaders.zip seem to be affected.

TODO:

- All games: Sprite zoom is probably not 100% accurate. In pspikes, the zooming text during attract mode is horrible.

- pspikes/turbofrc/aerofgtb write to two addresses which look like control registers for a video generator. Maybe they control the display size/position. aerofgt is different, it writes to consecutive memory addresses and the values it writes don't seem to be related to these ones.


NOTES:

- Various Video System Co. games using the C7-01 GGA, VS8803, VS8904, VS8905 video chips. C7-01 GGA is used in a lot of games, some of them without sprites. So it either controls tilemaps, or the video signal, or both. I think 8904/8905 handle sprites, don't know about 8803. tail2nos doesn't have the 8904/8905, and indeed it has a different sprite system.

NOTES:

- All II & V games are 68000, z80 plus a custom Alpha microcontroller, the microcontroller is able to write to anywhere within main memory.

- Gold Medalist (bootleg) has a 68705 in place of the Alpha controller.

- V boards have more memory and double the amount of colours as II boards.

- Time Soldiers - make the ROM writable and the game will enter a 'debug' kind of mode, probably from the development system used.

- Time Soldiers - Title screen is corrupt when set to 'Japanese language', the real board does this too!  (Battlefield is corrupt when set to English too).

- The Next Space is not an Alpha game, but the video hardware is identical to Paddlemania.

NOTES:

- Most if not all Arkanoid sets have a bug in their game code. It occurs on the final level where the player has to dodge falling objects.

For these addresses it is vital to read zero values, or else the player will die for no reason.

SOUND HARDWARE NOTES:

- Asteroids Sound System Analog emulation by K.Wilkins (Nov 2000).

- The Asteroid SAUCER sound is based on two VCOs, a slow VCO feed the input to a higher freq VCO with the SAUCERSEL switch being used to move the frequency ranges of both VCOs. The slow VCO is implemented with a 555 timer and a 566 is used for the higher VCO. The sound can be tweaked with the gain and adder constants in the 2 lines below. The Fire sound is produced by a 555 based VCO where the frequency rapidly decays with time. An RC filter is used for the decay with the inverse of the enable signal used. Thrust noise is just a gated noise source fed into a low pass RC filter. Explosion generation circuit, pitch and vol are variable. The Thump circuit is based on a VCO with the VCO control fed from the 4 low order bits from /THUMP bit 4 controls the osc enable. A resistor ladder network is used to convert the 4 bit value to an analog value. The VCO is implemented with a 555 timer and an RC filter to perform smoothing on the output. The sound can be tweaked with the gain and adder constants in the 2 lines below. Life enable is just 3Khz tone from the clock generation cct according to schematics. All 7 sound sources are combined with a double adder circuit.

- The Asteroid delux sound hardware is mostly done in the Pokey chip except for the thrust and explosion sounds that are a direct lift of the asteroids hardware hence is a clone of the circuit above apart from gain scaling. The Thrust noise is just a gated noise source fed into a low pass RC filter. Explosion generation circuit, pitch and vol are variable. All 7 sound sources are combined with a double adder circuit.

UMAMED NOTES:

- Space Lords (1992): (Aaron Giles) This is the first Atari game to use a 68020 processor. Other games to follow on similar hardware include Moto Frenzy, T-Mek, and Primal Rage. The video and sound hardware is quite similar to the previous games (Guardians of the Hood and Road Riot 4WD). However, the SLOOP chip appears to have gone away, only to be replaced by something equally sinister. Space Lords uses this chip to produce the palette for the sprites, which is why all the screenshots have incorrect colors. The protection chip is also used to produce some in-game parameters, making it nigh impossible to play without accurate emulation.

- Moto Frenzy (1992): (Aaron Giles) Runs on identical hardware to Space Lords. Again, the protection device is not understood well enough to give accurate emulation. Graphics are drawn correctly, but the colors are incorrect and gameplay is fouled up.

- Road Riot's Revenge Rally (1993): (Aaron Giles) Sequel to Road Riot 4WD running on the same hardware as Space Lords / Moto Frenzy. Again, the protection device and custom ASIC prevent accurate emulation. Road drawing and sprite positioning are incorrect.

NOTES:

- Driver is similar to Appoooh.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Bank Panic has a 32x8 palette PROM. I'm not sure whether the second 16 bytes are used - they contain the same colors as the first 16 with only one different and two 256x4 lookup table PROMs (one for charset #1, one for charset #2 - only the first 128 nibbles seem to be used). I don't know for sure how the palette PROM is connected to the RGB output, but it's probably the usual (see vidhrdw/bankp.c).

TODO:

- The two unknown writes for the MCU are probably watchdog reset and irq acknowledge, but they don't seem to work as expected. During the first few frames they are written out of order and hooking them up in the usual way causes the MCU to stop receiving interrupts.

- Remove the sound kludge in Baraduke. This might actually be a feature of the CUS30 chip.


NOTES:

- The sprite and tilemap generator ICs are the same as in Namco System 86, but System 86 has two tilemap generators instead of one.

- In floor 6 of baraduke, there are gaps in the big boss when the player moves. This is the correct behaviour, verified on the real board.


WIP:

- 0.80: Nicola Salmoria understood how sprite RAM buffering works, this fixes sprite lag but causes a glitch in rthunder (which might be correct behaviour) in baraduke.c and namcos86.c

TODO:

- Finish video driver: Some attributes are unknown. I don't remember the original game but seems there are some problems: misplaced sprites ? ( see beginning of level 1 or 2 for example ), sprite / sprite priority ? ( see level 2 the reflectors ), sprite / background priority ? ( see level 1: birds walk through branches of different trees ) and see the beginning of level 3: is the background screwed ?

- Get rid of input port hack: Controls appear to be mapped at 0xFE4000, alongside dip switches, but there is something strange going on that I can't (yet) figure out. Player controls and coin inputs are supposed to magically appear at 0xFFFFFB (coin/start) 0xFFFFFD (player 2) 0xFFFFFF (player 1). This is probably done by an MPU on the board (whose ROM is not available).

- The MPU also takes care of the commands for the sound CPU, which are stored at FFFFF9.

- IRQ4 seems to be control related. On each interrupt, it reads 0xFE4000 (coin/start), shift the bits around and move the resulting byte into a dword RAM location. The dword RAM location is rotated by 8 bits each time this happens. This is probably done to be pedantic about coin insertions (might be protection related). In fact, currently coin insertions are not consistently recognized.

NOTES:

- Quarth works, but Block Hole crashes when it reaches the title screen. An interrupt happens, and after rti the ROM bank is not the same as before so it jumps to garbage code. If you want to see this happen, place a breakpoint at 0x8612, and trace after that. The code is almost identical in the two versions, it looks like Quarth is working just because luckily the interrupt doesn't happen at that point. It seems that the interrupt handler trashes the selected ROM bank and forces it to 0. To prevent crashes, I only generate interrupts when the ROM bank is already 0. There might be another interrupt enable register, but I haven't found it.

- toki: Sound support is probably incomplete. There are a couple of unknown accesses done by the CPU, including to the YM2203 I/O ports. At the very least, there should be some filters.

- toki: "fake-r" routine make the "original" roms to restart the game after some seconds.

- toki: Well, we know very little about the 0xFE00 address. It could be some watchdog or a synchronization timer. I remember scanning the main CPU code to find how it was used on the bootleg set. Then I just figured out a constant value that made the game run (it hang if just set unhandled, that is, returning zero). Maybe the solution is to patch the bootleg ROMs to skip some tests at this location (I remember some of them being in the initialization routine of the main CPU).

- The way I'm handling opaqueness in the top portion of the screen is definitely wrong (see the high score entry screen). Actually there doesn't seem to be a way to make the fg opaque, but not doing so leaves parts of the bg visible at the top of the screen.

- The gradient sky is completely wrong - it's more of a placeholder to show that it's supposed to be there. It is supposed to skew along with the background, and the gradient can move around (the latter doesn't seem to be used except for making it cover the whole screen on the title screen, and start at the middle during gameplay)

- Sprite lag in some games (e.g. metmqstr). The sprites chip probably generates interrupts (unknown_irq)


Bugs:

- donpachi, ddonpach, esprade, guwange (plus maybe other non-shooters): Sprites (ground objects) got out of sync with backgrounds in 0.53. They were completely in line with BGs until 37b15. Linked are shots of the same object in esprade. The left one is when I make the screen scrolled to the right, and right one is to the left. The part of diagonal lines is hidden by the foreground object on the right shot. I mean .. you can easily notice the similar behaviour if you play Gun Frontier or Ray Force and scroll from side to side. Spirites are not in line with backgrounds in them. Update: Here is another example of the bug in action. cavec053gre Fujix


Inp:

- ddonpach, dfeveron, esprade, guwange: Playback doesn't work correctly unless sound is disabled when you record them. Will lose sync if there is sound enabled. This is, I believe, also caused by sound IRQ callback from the sound chip. It can be "fixed" by commenting out the reference to the IRQ callback function in ymz280b_intf and replacing it with zero. This has the side effect of some sound effects not playing, and I'm sure it wouldn't be considered to be used in an official MAME build. But it may at least point to some way to properly fix it.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Crystal Castles doesn't have a color PROM. It uses RAM to dynamically create the palette. The resolution is 9 bit (3 bits per gun). The palette contains 32 entries, but it is accessed through a memory windows 64 bytes long: writing to the first 32 bytes sets the msb of the red component to 0, while writing to the last 32 bytes sets it to 1. The first 16 entries are used for sprites; the last 16 for the background bitmap. I don't know the exact values of the resistors between the RAM and the RGB output, I assumed the usual ones.

The meanings of the four bits are (all bits are inverted): bit 3= alternate, bit 2= blue, bit 1= green and bit 0 red. The alternate bit affects blue and green, not red.

TODO:

- No backgrounds ROMs from the original board... This may be related to the SubCPU. I don't think it's contributing much right now, but I could be wrong. And it would explain that vast expanse of bankswitch ROM on a slave CPU.... Just had a look at the sprites, and they seem like kosher sprites all the way up.... So it must be hidden in the sub-cpu somewhere? Got two bootleg sets with background gfx roms. Using those on the original games for now.

- Timers are too fast and/or too slow, and the whole thing's moving too fast

- Port 0x2800 on the Sub CPU: All those I/O looking ports on the main CPU (0x3exx and 0x3fxx). One's scroll control. Prolly other vidhrdw control as well. Location 0x1a2ec in cgate51.bin (The main CPU's ROM) is 88. This is copied to videoram, and causes that minor visual discrepancy on the title screen. But the CPU tests that part of the ROM and passes it OK. Since it's just a simple summing of words, another word somewhere (or others in total) has lost 0x8000. Or the original game had this problem. (Not on the screenshot I got). The Japanese ones have a different title screen so I can't check.

- ADPCM in the bootlegs is not quite right.... Misusing the data? They're nibble-swapped versions of the original roms... There's an Intel i8748 CPU on the bootlegs (bootleg 1 lists D8749 but the microcode dump's the same). This in conjunction with the different ADPCM chip (msm5205) are used to 'fake' a M6295. Bootleg 1 ADPCM is now wired up, but still not working :-( Definantly sync problems between the i8049 and the m5205 which need further looking at.

It also contains functions to print text on the screen (0xffe04230), so should be good a good start for the gfx emulation. The checksum test routine is wrong, e.g. when it says to be testing 4U/8U it is actually reading 4U/8U/3U/7U, when testing 3U/7U it actually reads 2U/6U/1U/5U. The placement cannot therefore be exactly determined by the check passing.

We then draw a truck image in the proper place and continue scanning. This is not a perfect emulation of the game hardware, but it should suffice for the way the game software uses the hardware. It does take care of the problem of displaying multiple beer trucks and of scrolling truck images smoothly off the top of the screen.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Marvel Vs. Capcom: Sometimes currupt gfx are displayed on the 32x32 layer as the screen flashes at the start of super combo moves. The problem seems to be due to tiles being fetched before the first 32x32 tile offset and results in data coming from 16x16 or 8x8 tiles instead.

- SF2: Missing chain in the foreground in Ken's level, and sign in Cun Li's level. Those graphics are in the backmost layer.

- UN Squadron: DOT TEST in service mode shows garbage chars.

- Magic Sword: during attract mode, characters are shown with a black background. There is a background, but the layers are disabled. I think this IS the correct behaviour.

- King of Dragons (World): Distortion effect missing on character description screen during attract mode. The game rapidly toggles on and off the layer enable bit. Again, I think this IS the correct behaviour. The Japanese version does the distortion as expected.

NOTES:

- Driver by Paul Leaman and thanks to Raz, Crashtest and the CPS2 decryption team without whom none of this would have been possible.

- CPS2 Encryption: The CPS2 system has a watchdog system that will disable the decryption of data if the watchdog isn't triggered at least once every few seconds. The trigger varies from game to game (some games do use the same) and is basically a 68000 opcode/s instruction. Currently the algorhythm is unknown so instead we use ready decrypted data obtained from real hardware to create XOR files. These files are then used against the encrypted program ROM's to decrypt them. All that is known about the algorhythm so far is that it only uses the lower 17 bits of the possible 24 address lines, this basically means the encryption loops on 0x20000 boundries.

- Dimahoo requires the C 68k core for attract mode to sync collectly with mucic. If the ASM 68k core is used GFX slow at the point where the blue pictures fade in and out. This bug also seems to change the speed of the medallion fade out at the start of Giga Wing's attract mode. This could be the same bug in the ASM core that causes the NeoGeo game view point to stop working.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- CPS2 can do raster effects, certainly used by ssf2 (Cammy, DeeJay, T.Hawk levels), msh (lava level, early in attract mode) and maybe others (xmcotaj, vsavj). IRQ4 is some sort of scanline interrupt used for that purpose.

- Its unknown what CPS2_OBJ_BASE register (0x400000) does but it is not a object base register. All games use 0x7000 even if 0x7080 is used at this register (checked on real HW). Maybe it sets the object bank used when cps2_objram_bank is set?

- Sprites are currently lagged by one frame to keep sync with backgrounds. This causes sprites to stay on screen one frame longer (visable in VSAV attract mode).

NOTES:

- Hardware: CPS3 Games are supplied with a CD and Cartridge. CD contains the game data, Cartridge appears to contain a chip for the encryption and a BIOS rom. The CPU is thought to be SH-2 based, the cartridges are backed up by a battery and are highly sensitive. Very few games were produced for this system (6 in total)

- ddenlovr: understand the extra commands for the blitter compressed data, used only by this game.

- ddenlovr: sometimes the colors of the girl in the presentation before the beginning of a stage are wrong, and they correct themselves when the board is drawn.

- The palette problems mentioned above happen in other games as well, e.g. quizchq attract mode.

- the registers right after the palette bank selectors (e00048-e0004f in ddenlovr) are not understood. They are related to the layer enable register and to the unknown blitter register 05. ddenlovr has a function at 001798 to initialize these four registers. It uses a table with 7 possible different layouts. The table is copied to e00048-e0004f and is also used to create a 16-entry array used to feed blitter register 05. Every element of the array is the OR of the values in the table above corresponding to bits set in the layer enable register. Note that in the table above the top 4 bits are split among the four entries.

- There's also a kludge to fix the zooming Dynax logo in ddenlovr, the palette base registers are all set to 0xff, so it would use the wrong palette otherwise.

- The meaning of blitter commands 43 and 8c is not understood.

- quizchq: inputs/dips

- quizchq: some samples are played at the wrong pitch

NOTES:

- The driver is a complete mess ATM.

- Hardware: Dynax/Nakanihon games using a graphics blitter.

- The zooming Dynax logo in ddenlovr would flicker because the palette is updated one frame after the bitmap. This is fixed using a framebuffer but I don't think it's correct.

NOTES:

- Driver: Driver by Bryan McPhail, thanks go to Avedis and The Guru.

- Hardware: The Data East MLC system is basically an 8" x 6" x 2" plastic box with a JAMMA connector on it. The PCB's are very compact and have almost entirely surface mounted components on both sides of both boards. One board contains the RAM, sound hardware and I/O, the other board contains the CPU and ROMs. All main boards are identical between the MLC games and can be changed just by plugging in another game and pressing test to reset the EEPROM defaults.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The MLC graphics hardware is quite complicated - the usual method of having 'object ram' that controls sprites is expanded into object ram that controls sprite blocks that may be stored in RAM or ROM. Each tile in a block may be specified explicitly via a display list in ROM or calculated as part of a block offset.

- Blocks can be scaled and subpositioned, and are usually 4bpp but blocks can be combined into 8bpp with a flag.


WIP:

- 0.78u1: Bryan McPhail change driver avengrgs.c to deco_mls.c (Data East MLC). Many aspects of the Video Rendering have been improved, Avengers in Galactic storm is playable with some characters now, however there seems to be a CPU core bug affecting various aspects of the game, most notably the flipping of Captain America. Help tracking down and fixing this would be welcome. Several Non-Working sets were also added.

-  8th February 2001: Juergen Buchmueller managed to fix some 8x41 emulation bugs and got a few DECO Cassette system games running: Super Astro Fighter, Pro Golf and Mission X (the last one with wrong colors though). Accurate to the original, the games need 1 - 2 minutes to load from the simulated tape. Also many thanks to Al Kossow for his incredible work on preserving this system that was near extinction.

- 31st January 2001: Juergen Buchmueller further fixed the i8x41 core and hooked some parts of the DECO cassette system to the Burger Time driver.

TODO:

- The logicpr2 OKIM6295 ROM has four banks, but the game seems to only use 0 and 1.

- Logicpro dip switches might be wrong (using the logicpr2 ones)

- Flip screen is not supported but these games don't use it (no flip screen dip and no cocktail mode)

- If it's like System 16, the top bit of palette ram should be an additional bit for Green. But is it ever not 0?


NOTES:

- They call the hardware "deniam-16", but it's actually pretty much identical to Sega System 16.


Bugs:

- logicpro, logicpr2: Service mode bugs: logicpro: pressing f12 does not go into service mode. logicpr2: in sound self test pressing left or right does not change the number of the sound/music to be tested (it has been like this since first emulated in MAME). Also, if following a graphical test sometimes the backgrounds are retained when entering other tests (eg try colour test and follow with coin switch or sound tests). deniamc37b15gre2 Chook

- Background sound is not playing correctly. Extremely noticeable in karianx, happens quite often in logicpro but croquis mostly works ok. In karianx it manifests itself as no background music at all after game starts. Sometimes even the sound effects stop. In logicpro, it sometimes skips the background music in the scenes where the monkey walks across the screen but now and again the background music will drop right out after a sound effect. In croquis it seems hardly effected but again sometimes the monkey scenes have no background music. This did not just happen in mame074. I have traced this back to its origin in mame071u2. The background music in deniam.c has not worked correctly since that build. All versions of mame checked had -createconfig run prior to testing so it's not a config issue. deniamc074gre Chook

- The analog inputs come from the player's depth control potentiometer. The voltage is compared to a voltage ramp provided by a discrete analog circuit that conditions the VBLANK signal. When the ramp voltage exceeds the input voltage an NMI signal is generated. The computer then reads the VSYNC data functions to tell where the cursor should be located. *

TODO:

- Inputs are grossly mapped, especially for the card games.

- In the interleaved games, "reverse write" test in service mode is wrong due to interleaving. Correct behaviour? None of these games has a "flip screen" dip switch, while mjfriday and mjdialq2, which aren't interleaved, have it.

- Palette banking is not correct, see quiztvqq cross hatch test.

- Rom banking of the blitter roms: it can only address 0x100000 bytes.

- Scrolling / wrap enable is not correct in hnoridur type hardware. See the dynax logo in neruton: it has to do with writes to c3/c4 and there are 2 additional scroll registers at 64/66.

- 7jigen: priority 0x30 is ok when used in the "gals check", but is wrong during attract mode, where the girl is hidden by the background. Another possible priority issue in attract mode is when the balls scroll over the devil.


NOTES:

- In some games (drgpunch etc) there's a more complete service mode. To enter it, set the service mode dip switch and reset keeping start1 pressed. In hnkochou, keep F2 pressed and reset.

- sprtmtch and drgpunch are "clones", but the gfx are very different; sprtmtch is a trimmed down version, without all animations between levels.

- according to the readme, mjfriday should have a M5205. However there don't seem to be accesses to it, and looking at the ROMs I don't see ADPCM data. Note that apart from a minor difference in the memory map mjfriday and mjdialq2 are identical, and mjdialq2 doesn't have a 5205 either. Therefore, I think it's either a mistake in the readme or the chip is on the board but unused.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

TODO:

- Super Blob uses a busy loop during the color test to split the screen between the two palettes. This effect is not emulated, but since both halfs of the palette are identical, this is not an issue. See $039c. The other games have a different color test, not using the busy loop.


NOTES:

- Super Glob seems like a later revision of The Glob, the most obvious difference being an updated service mode.

- These games don't have cocktail mode.

- The divisor 4 was derived using the timing loop used to split the screen in the middle. This loop takes roughly 24200 cycles, giving 2500 + (24200 - 2500) * 2 * 60 = 2754000 = 2.75MHz for the CPU speed, assuming 60 fps and a 2500 cycle VBLANK period. This should be easy to check since the schematics are available, .

- Emulation: Equites has sprite lag in the post-rotate X direction depends on interrupt timing. Scale factors in High Voltage and Splendor Blast are inaccurate. Actual values are believed to be in the three unknown ROM s3.8l, 1.9j and 4.7m but the equations are unknown. MSM5232 clock speed and capacitor values are not known. There seems to be a rheostat on Equites' soundboard to adjust the MSM5232's music pitch. It hasn't been confirmed whether music tempos are the same across all games.


NOTES:

- All games: To enter sort of "test mode", bits 0 and 1 need to be ON when the game is reset. Acho said that it could be a switch (but I'm not sure of that), and that's why I've added a EASY_TEST_MODE compilation switch.

- equites: When in "test mode", press START1 to cycle through next sound, and press START2 to directly test the inputs and the Dip Switches. When the number of buttons is set to 2, you need to press BOTH BUTTON1 and BUTTON2 to have the same effect as BUTTON3.

- bullfgtr: When in "test mode", press START1 to cycle through next sound, and press START2 to directly test the inputs and the Dip Switches. I'm not sure I understand how the coinage is handled, and so it's hard to make a good description. Anyway, the values are correct.

- kouyakyu: When in "test mode", press START1 to cycle through next sound, and press START2 to directly test the inputs and the Dip Switches. Bit 1 of Dip Switch is only read in combinaison of bit 0 during P.O.S.T. to enter the "test mode", but it doesn't add any credit ! That's why I've patched the inputs, so you can enter the "test mode" by pressing COIN1 during P.O.S.T.

- splndrbt: When starting a 2 players game, when player 1 game is over, the game enters in an infinite loop on displaying the "GAME OVER" message. You can test player 2 by putting 0xff instead of 0x00 at 0x040009 ($9,A6). FYI, what should change the contents of $9,A6 is the routine at 0x000932, but I haven't found where this routine could be called 8( 8303 issue ?

- hvoltage: When starting a 2 players game, when player 1 game is over, the game becomes buggy on displaying the "GAME OVER" message and you can't start a new game anymore. You can test player 2 by putting 0xff instead of 0x00 at 0x040009 ($9,A6). FYI, what should change the contents of $9,A6 is the routine at 0x000fc4, but I haven't found where this routine could be called 8( 8404 issue ? There is sort of "debug mode" that you can access if 0x000038.w returns 0x0000 instead of 0xffff. To enable it, turn HVOLTAGE_HACK to 1 then enable the fake Dip Switch. When you are in "debug mode", the Inputs and Dip Switches have special features.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Exidy hardware checks for two types of collisions based on the video signals. If the Motion Object 1 and Motion Object 2 signals are on at the same time, an M1M2 collision bit gets set. If the Motion Object 1 and Background Character signals are on at the same time, an M1CHAR collision bit gets set. So effectively, there's a pixel-by-pixel collision check comparing Motion Object 1 (the player) to the background and to the other Motion Object (typically a bad guy).

[Ernesto Corvi]


NOTES:

- The main 6502 cpu is a custom one. The differences with a regular 6502 is as follows: Extra opcode ( $4b00 ), wich i think reads an external port. VBlank irq is on bit 1 ( 0x02 ). Reset, IRQ and NMI vectors are moved. Also, there was some protection circuitry which is now emulated.

- The way i dealt with the custom opcode was to change it to return memory position $ff (wich i verified is not used by the game). And i hacked in a read handler wich returns the vblank on bit 1. It's an ugly hack, but works fine.

- The bootleg version patched the rom to get rid of the extra opcode ( bootlegs used a regular 6502 ), the vectors hardcoded in place, and also had the protection cracked.

- The background tiles had a very ugly encoding. It was so ugly that our decode gfx routine will not be able to decode it without some little help. So thats why exprraid_gfx_expand() is there. Many thanks to Phil Stroffolino, who figured out the encoding.

- The Bootlegs: 1st bootleg set expects to read vblank status from 0x3800, country warning sign has been defaced by the bootleggers. 2nd bootleg set expects to read vblank status from 0xFFC0, country warning sign is intact, however Credit is spelt incorrectly.

NOTES:

- The games run on a modified Galaxian board.

- Fly-Boy/Fast Freddie uses a big hack routine, this is the only way to get the game working without knowing anything about the way the protection chip works. These values were derived based on disassembly of the code. Usually, it was pretty obvious what the values should be. Of course, this will have to change if a different ROM set ever surfaces.

- There is a bug in Fast Freddie that causes these locations to be read. See 1b5a, one of the instructions should be ld de instead of ld hl.

- Some games have two RGB outputs to allow two or four simultaneous players linking two cabinets (World Rally 2, Touch & Go). In 2 monitors mode, the hardware maps one tilemap to a monitor and the other tilemap to the other monitor. The game palette is splitted, using the first half for one monitor and the second half for the other monitor. The sprite RAM has one bit that selects the sprite's target monitor. The sound is splitted too, right channel for cabinet 1 and the left channel for the other cabinet.

TODO:

- EEPROM interface not right

WIP:

-  2nd March 2004: Aaron Giles fixed a bug in the TMS32031 CPU core which caused bad geometry in Surf Planet, and he fixed other rendering bugs in the Gaelco 3D driver so that it works better.

-  2nd March 2004: Aaron Giles - After getting Radikal Bikers working well, I decided to figure out what was up with Surf Planet. Turns out they were relying on unspecified behavior of the TMS32031 by placing a CALL statement at the end of a repeat block. They tell you several times in the docs for the CPU never to do this, but hey, I guess if it works more power to them. With that fixed and some rendering tweaks, I'm currently getting about 30-50% of full speed on my 3GHz machine. If I turn off bilinear filtering and run at half resolution, both games are playable near 100%. Of course, I don't have the sound working yet, and that will kill the speed nicely (it's a DCS-like ADSP chip, sorry!)

-  1st March 2004: Aaron Giles turned on bilinear filtering by default in the Gaelco 3D driver.

- 28th February 2004: Aaron Giles - Z buffering and perspective correction are fixed (see http://www.flipcode.com/documents/texmap.txt)

- 24th February 2004: Aaron Giles - Fixed a subtle bug in the TMS32031 core that was causing problems with Radikal Bikers. Now at least all the geometry shows up okay. I'm still at a loss to explain alpha blending, Z buffering, or perspective correction. The incomplete driver should be in u2, so if you know some 3D math, feel free to have a look and see if you can't help me figure it out!

- 16th February 2004: Aaron Giles sent in a preliminary version of the Gaelco 3D driver (Surf Planet and Radikal Bikers) which works somewhat but graphics rendering is not perfect.

- 14th February 2004: Aaron Giles - Still stumped on the perspective correction, but I managed to figure out how the texture masking works so that text no longer has big blocks on the outside. Turns out some of the ROMs provide a 1bpp mask for certain textures. Also, I managed to get Surf Planet up and running. It's on the same hardware, but with a 68000 instead of a 68EC020. If you know MAME, you'll know that it's kind of a pain to do this because you can't just substitute a 68000 directly for a 68EC020 due to different data bus widths. Now if we can just dig up a Speed Up PCB and send it to Guru, I'll have all of the known Gaelco games on this hardware to play with.

- 13th February 2004: Aaron Giles - Well, as long as everything is drawn straight on, it looks great. Unfortunately, the 3D hardware apparently does support perspective correction, so right now everything kind of looks like this. I've spent several hours trying to wrap my poor brain around the parameters to get at the perspective correction, but I'm pretty close to stumped for the moment.

- 11th February 2004: Aaron Giles - Palettes and controls are hooked up, I can coin up and start a game. I figured out how the texture data is distributed across four ROMs in little 2x2 squares, which is pretty solid evidence that there was bilinear filtering in the original game. There are still some serious issues with understanding the texture coordinates, but I'm at least confident I'm pointing to the correct texture to start with, given that I can read the text in the service mode. I have a feeling progress will slow down now until I can wrap my head around the math.

- 10th February 2004: Aaron Giles - I'm startlingly pleased to see something like this after only a few days work. The 3D chip gets passed 13 values (10 floating point, 3 fixed point), plus 2 additional values per vertex. This is just some connect-the-dots on the vertexes being passed, but it's encouraging to see the pipeline working. I'm still trying to deduce most of the other parameters, which probably have to do with things like texture coordinates, Z buffering, and maybe even lighting (let's hope not!).

TODO:

- Make sure all of the protection accesses in raiga are handled correctly.

- Work out how lower priority sprites are affected by blended sprites.


NOTES:

- The sprite Y size control is slightly different from gaiden/wildfang to raiga. In the first two, size X and Y change together, while in the latter they are changed independently. This is handled with a variable set in DRIVER_INIT, but it might also be a selectable hardware feature, since the two extra bits used by raiga are perfectly merged with the rest. Raiga also uses more sprites than the others, but there's no way to tell if hardware is more powerful or the extra sprites were just not needed in the earlier games.

- The hardware supports blending sprites and background. There are 3 copies of the palette; one for pixels that aren't blended, one for pixels that are behind the object that will be blended and one for the object that will be blended. Blending is performed by switching to the appropriate palettes for the pixels behind the blended object and the object itself, and then adding the RGB values.

- Wild Fang / Tecmo Knight has a simple protection. It writes codes to 0x07a804, and reads the answer from 0x07a007. The returned values contain the address of a function to jump to.

TODO:

- bosco & galaga: The starfield is wrong. The function of STARCLR is unknown. It is not latched and there are no data bits used...

- bosco: is the scrolling tilemap placement correct? It is currently aligned so that the test grid shown on startup is correct, but this way an unerased grey strip remains on the left of the screen during the title sequence.

- xevious: the watchdog should fire if not reset for 8 frames, I think. MAME is currently hardwired to wait 3 seconds. This causes credit sounds to play for a while when the test mode switch is toggled because the machine doesn't reset soon enough.

- Should Xevios have a 4th Z80 like the other bootlegs? We don't have a dump for that ROM.

- xevious: I haven't found any Easter egg in service mode. The main loop is very simple so there might just not be one, though this would be the only Namco game of that era to not have a service mode Easter egg. On the other hand, the service mode in this game is VERY spartan when compared to the other Namco games.

- dzigzag: emulate the 4th CPU (should be similar to battles)


NOTES:

- The Cabinet Type "dip switch" actually comes from the edge connector, but is mapped in memory in place of dip switch #8. dip switch #8 selects single/dual coin counters and is entirely handled by hardware.

- galaga: there is a bug in the sound CPU program. During initialization, it enables NMI before clearing RAM, but the NMI handler doesn't save the registers, so it cannot interrupt program execution. If the NMI happens before the LDIR that clears RAM has finished, the program will crash. To prevent this, I had to use a custom interrupt_gen, timing NMI generation appropriately.

- galaga: there were "fast shoot" hacks available, which are not supported. Their effects can be replicated with this line in cheat.dat: galaga:1:070D:0D:100:Fast Shoot

- bosco: we have two dumps of the sound shape ROM, "prom.1d" and "bosco.spr". Music changes a lot from one version to the other. I'm using the former because it is more similar to the other Namco games. The latter, after masking off the unused top 4 bits and inverting bit 3, matches the Galaga one, so it might have come from a (bootleg?) conversion.

- bosco & galaga: the Midway arcade cabinet had an optional rapid fire board, using a 556 to generate autofire while the button was held. That really makes little sense in Galaga! For Bosconian, I guess it was for the boscomdo set I, because the other sets have autofire built-in.

- The bosconian video system is (apart from the starfield) almost identical functionally to Rally X, but the hardware is quite different: Rally X has no custom ICs.

- digdug: if you enter service mode and press press service coin something like the following is written at the bottom of the screen: 99.9999.9999.9999.9999. This is explained in the manual: it is the number of games played, of points, etc. The counters start from 999 and count backwards.

- gallag is identical to galagao, apart from the title changed to "GALLAG" and the copyright notice changed from "(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD" to "1 9 8 2" (and the Namco logo removed from the gfx). The only interesting thing about it is the 4th Z80, used to simulate the custom 5xXX chips of the original. It also has different explosion and starfield circuitries, to do without the Namco custom chips.

- Differences between versions of digdug: The background graphics are slightly different in the Atari version, the earth is less regular, "digdugb" and "digduga1" are identical, apart from the gfx and copyright notices changed from "NAMCO LTD." to "ATARI INC.". "digdug" is almost identical to "digdugat" (apart from the above changes), but there are three more instructions in the latter that change the code alignment. "dzigzag" and "digdugb" are identical, apart from the hacked gfx and the copyright notices changed from "NAMCO LTD." to "1 9 8 2". It's a bottleg of "digdugb", and not of "digduga1", because the hidden "NAMCO" string at offset 0x1eea of CPU2 is still present, while it is replaced by "ATARI" in digduga1. The only interesting thing about the bootleg is the 4th Z80, used to simulate the custom 5xXX chips of the original.

- The digitised speech in Bosconian is stored in the SOUND2 roms.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Galaga has one 32x8 palette PROM and two 256x4 color lookup table PROMs (one for characters, one for sprites). Only the first 128 bytes of the lookup tables seem to be used.

- Dig Dug has one 32x8 palette PROM and two 256x4 color lookup table PROMs (one for characters, one for sprites). Only the first 128 bytes of the lookup tables seem to be used.

NOTES:

- The only code difference between 'galaxian' and 'galmidw' is that the 'BONUS SHIP' text is printed on a different line.

- Moon Cresta versions: mooncrs2 is probably the first revision (no patches), has ROM/RAM check code and came from a bootleg board, with the logos erased from the graphics. mooncrsb is a bootleg of mooncrs2 with ROM/RAM check erased. mooncrst and mooncrsu are later revision as mooncrsa and all have better demo mode and text for docking. mooncrst and mooncrsa are encrypted and mooncrsu is unencrypted. All have no ROM/RAM check. mooncrsg from Gremlin has the same docking text as mooncrst.


Bugs:

- blkhole, azurian, warofbug, omega, maybe others: Explosion sound doesn't cut off after you get hit. It lasts until (depending on the game) you start another game or reset. This does not happen in galaxian (and its plethora of clones) or batman2. Update: The sound bug also happens in scramblb (lasts until the screen updates with your new ship, but stays at the end of the game) and skybase (lasts until the screen updates with your new ship). Along with the other games I mentioned, that's it. Moon Cresta (and its clones) and King & Balloon seem to be unaffected. These and the others are the only games in galaxian.c that use that explosion sample (obviously the "space shooter" games). Update: frogg exhibits the same "explosion sample" bug as the other game mentioned in that report. This happens when Frog(ger) gets hit by a car, and it doesn't cut off until you reset. galaxianc058gre The tECHIDNA

TODO:

- Four unknown ROMs in fantasia. The game seems to work fine without them.

- There was a ROM in the newfant set, obj2_14.rom, which was identical to Terminator 2's t2.107. I can only assume this was a mistake of the dumper.

- lots of unknown reads and writes, also in galpanic but particularly in the Comad ones.

- fantasia and newfant have a service mode but they doesn't work well (text is missing or replaced by garbage). This might be just how the games are.

- Is there a background enable register? Or a background clear. fantasia and newfant certainly look ugly as they are.


NOTES:

- The Comad games run on hardware similar to Gals Panic, with a different sprite system. They are not ROM swaps because the addresses of work RAM and of the OKI chip change from one to the other, however everything else is pretty much identical.

- Gals Panic: The current ROM set is strange because two ROMs overlap two others replacing the program. It's definitely a Kaneko boardset, but it could very well be they converted some other game to run Gals Panic, because there's some ROMs piggybacked on top of each other and some ROMs on a daughterboard plugged into smaller sized ROM sockets. It's not a pirate version. The piggybacked ROMs even have Kaneko stickers. The silkscreen on the board says PAMERA-4. There is at least another version of the Gals Panic board. It's single board, so no daughterboard. There are only 4 IC's socketed, the rest is soldered to the board, and no piggybacked ROMs. Board number is MDK 321 V-0    EXPRO-02

Actually, looking at the code it seems to roll overs at level 0x2f, and indeed the data for levels 0x30-0x37 isn't valid (player starts into a wall, or there are invisible walls, etc.) The 0x6000-0x7fff ROM space doesn't seem to be used: instead the game writes to 6048 and reads from 6000.

[Fabrice Frances, Nicola Salmoria]


NOTES:

- There was a bug in the hardware of the GG1 and GG2 boards, which is not emulated. The bug seems to have disappeared with the later revision of the board, e.g the board used by 3Stooges and Mach3 don't seem to have it). The bug was affecting the first character column (on horizontal games): screen memory could be used, but whatever was stored in this column, always the same character was displayed. This led to two consequences: 1. The image on the monitor had to be stretched so that the column was not visible. 2. Game designers were not using the first column. In fact, when the first column was ejected from the screen, the last one was usually out too, so it wasn't used either...

- The Laser Disc Player games: The machines use Philips 24-bit frame number code. The 4 most significant bits of the code are 1's and these four 1's are used to detect a valid frame number when shifting bits from right to left. From the audio code it seems it's a simple BCD numbering. (what happens when four consecutive 1's are inside the number, eg 00078 ?) Only 19 bits are returned to the game machine, this gives a max frame number of 79999. The size of the audio buffer is 1024 bytes. When it is full, the "audio buffer ready" flag is raised, and the frame decoder tries again to synchronize with a 0x67 pattern Each 1024-byte buffer contains target data for 53 frames; target data for each frame is 19-bytes long including one byte of checksum and the frame number code of the first of these 53 frames is stored at the beginning. This gives a total of 1+3+3+19*53=1014 bytes, the 10 last bytes are ignored.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Gottlieb games dosn't have a color PROM. They use 32 bytes of RAM to dynamically create the palette. Each couple of bytes defines one color (4 bits per pixel; the high 4 bits of the second byte are unused). The RAM is conected to the RGB output.

NOTES:

- About GotYa (from the board owner): I believe it is a prototype for several reasons. There were quite a few jumpers on the board, hand written labels with the dates on them. I also have the manual, the game name is clearly Got-Ya and is a Game-A-Tron game. The game itself had a few flyers from GAT inside so I have a hard time believing it was a bootleg. So despite the fact that 'gotya' might look like its a bootleg of thehand, its more likely just a prototype / alternate version, its hard to tell.

- This board uses the well known 052109 051962 custom gfx chips, however unlike all other games they fetch gfx data from RAM. The gfx ROMs are memory mapped on cpu B and the needed parts are copied to RAM at run time. To handle this efficiently in MAME, some changes would be required to the tilemap system and to vidhrdw/konamiic.c. For the time being, I'm kludging my way in. There's also something wrong in the way tile banks are implemented in konamiic.c. They don't seem to be used by this game. The visible area is dubious. It looks like it is supposed to be asymmetrical, I've set it that way however this will break cocktail flip (since it expects a symmetrical visible area).

- Ground Effects is effectively a 30Hz game - though the vblank interrupts still come in at 60Hz, the game uses a hardware frame counter to limit itself to 30Hz (it only updates things like the video registers every other vblank). There isn't enough cpu power in a 16MHz 68020 to run this game at 60Hz.

- Tilemap scrolling/rotation/zooming or whatever effect it needs

- Priorities are wrong. I suspect they need sprite orthogonality

- Missing mixer registers (mainly layer enable/disable)

- Merge with other Video System games ?


NOTES:

- Both games seem to be similar hardware, V Goal Soccer doesn't work. The hardware is also quite similar to several other Video System games.

- In particular, the sound hardware is identical to aerofgt (including the memory mapping of the Z80, it's really just a romswap), and the sprite chip (Fujitsu CG10103) is the same used in several Video System games (see the notes in the vidhrdw).

- Grand Striker has an IRQ2 which is probably network related.

- DSWs need correctly mapping, they're just commented for the moment.

- Similar, but not identical hardware, appear to be protected by an MCU: V Goal Soccer and World Cup '94

TODO:

- FLIPX support in taitoic.c is not quite correct - the Taito logo is wrong, and the floor in the Doom levels has horizontal scrolling where it shouldn't.

- No networked machine support

- Coin lockout not working (see gunbustr_input_w): perhaps this was a prototype version without proper coin handling?


NOTES:

- Gunbuster uses a slightly enhanced sprite system from the one in Taito Z games. The key feature remains the use of a sprite map rom which allows the sprite hardware to create many large zoomed sprites on screen while minimizing the main cpu load. This feature makes the SZ system complementary to the F3 system which, owing to its F2 sprite hardware, is not very well suited to 3d games. (Taito abandoned the SZ system once better 3d hardware platforms were available in the mid 1990s.) Gunbuster also uses the TC0480SCP tilemap chip (like the last Taito Z game, Double Axle).

TODO:

- All games: There is some code that allows you to select your starting level (at 0x08dc in 'gunsmoka' and at 0x08d2 in the other sets). To do so, once the game has booted (after the "notice" screen), turn the "service" mode Dip Switch ON, and change Dip Switches DSW 1-0 to 1-3 (which are used by coinage). You can also set GUNSMOKE_HACK to 1 and change the fake "Starting Level" Dip Switch. About the ingame bug at the end of level 2 : enemy's energy (stored at 0xf790) is in fact not infinite, but it turns back to 0xff, so when it reaches 0 again, the boss is dead.

- 'gunsmoke': World version. You can enter 3 chars for your initials.

- 'gunsmokj': Japan version (but English text though). You can enter 8 chars for your initials.

- 'gunsmoku': US version licenced to Romstar. You can enter 3 chars for your initials.

- 'gunsmoku': US version licenced to Romstar. You can enter 3 chars for your initials. This is probably a later version of the game because some code has been added for the "Lives" Dip Switch that replaces the "Demonstation" one (so demonstration is always OFF). Other changes: Year is 1986 instead of 1985, High score is 110000 instead of 100000 and Levels 3 and 6 are swapped.


NOTES:

- In Gunsmoke there is a unknown routine at 0x0e69 that tries to read data starting at 0xc4c9. If this value is zero, it interprets the next two bytes as a jump address. This was resulting in a reboot which happens at the end of level 3 if you go too far to the right of the screen when fighting the level boss. A non-zero for the first byte seems to be harmless  (although it may not be the correct behaviour). This could be some devious protection or it could be a bug in the arcade game. It's hard to tell without pulling the code apart.

TODO:

- Status reads from blitter RAM aren't well understood. They probably includes both completion and collision flags.

- The blitter is missing many features, in particular certain sprites aren't erased properly.

- It isn't known how many independent planes of graphics the blitter manages. The starfield, for example, probably involves at least two additional planes orthogonal to the sprites and scroll layer.

- Background tiles inside the comet have wrong coordinates.

- Score digits have wrong colors.

- Blitter functions, especially those capable of screen warping, are unoptimized.

- The starfields can probably be represented and rendered by two simple lists instead of costly bitmaps.

- Ben Bero Beh has collision problems with the falling fireballs and a minor priority glitch with the "Elevator Action" baddies.

- Halley's Comet's undocumented DIP switches only work if the player1 start button is depressed during boot-up.


NOTES:

- Halley's Comet was created by Fukio Mitsuji (MTJ), who also created Bubble Bobble, Rainbow Islands, Syvalion, etc.

- Halley's starfields: Each star map is generated by two data sets pointed by the second source address. The first 256-byte set has scattered bits to reflect the star population while the second 256-byte set appears to have random values. When the game runs the the star fields are updated a small portion at a time by a third data set containing gradient patterns which may indicate gray shades or alpha levels. Halley's Comet draws and clears the two star fileds as if they are independent from the backgrounds, making it a total of four scrollable layers. However, only two pairs of scroll registers are in use and they affect the stars and the backgrounds together - possibly afterthoughts on the original Ben Bero Beh hardware. This algorithm is based on speculation and deemed inaccurate.

- Halley's sound: How the custom chips handle sound latching is largely unknown. Halley's Comet dumps sound commands to register ff8a so rapidly the AY8910 core sometimes fails to reset itself and the music stops. Masking sound NMI is not enough to ensure successive writes are processed properly so it is advisable to queue sound commands or make the main CPU yield for a minimum of 600 Z80 cycles. Furthermore, soundlatch NMI interval should not be too much shorter than music IRQ's period(27306667ns), and must be longer in case of a reset(00).

- Halley's collision detection: The blitter hardware does per-pixel comparison between two sprite groups. When a collision occurs the ID's(memory offsets/16) of the intersecting pair are written to ff8b(certain) and ff67(?). Then the blitter causes an alternate IRQ to alert the CPU and a second check is performed in software to verify the collision. The trial emulation of the above was painfully slow and inaccurate because collisions are not verified immediately during IRQ. Instead, a dedicated loop is run between game logic and VBLANK to constantly check whether new collision ID's have been reported. The blitter somehow knows to IRQ at the right moment but I couldn't find any clear-cut triggers within the register area. It is possible to bypass blitter-side collision altogether by feeding a redundant sprite list to the main CPU, given that the processor is fast enough. This method works reliably at 5MHz or above and will certainly break under 4MHz.

- Driver: Phil Stroffolino for the creation of a solid framework, Jarek Burczynski for adding sound and providing awesome hand-drawn schematics and Jason MacFarlane for invaluable videos and screen shots.

- Sound and inputs don't work in mjikaga. CPU communication issue? Coins and dip switches *do* work however. Also note that bit 2 of bankswitch_w() and bit 7 of pteacher_blitter_bank_w() might have some other function, since the ROMs are smaller.

- Wrong gfx in mrokumei at the beginning of a game. It is selecting the wrong gfx bank; the bank handling seems correct in all other games, so I don't know what's wrong here.

- mjikaga shows some imperfections with horizontal placement of the screen.

- In attract mode, hourouki draws a horizontal black bar on the bottom right side of the display.


NOTES:

- To access service mode in the older mahjong games, keep F2 pressed during boot. Service mode doesn't work in hourouki because it needs an additional "check" ROM.

- The "help" button some games ask you to press is the start button.

- The games can change visible area at runtime. The meaning of the control registers isn't understood, but it supported enough to give the correct visible area to all games. mjkinjas sets the registers to values different from all the other games; it also has a 11MHz xtal instead of the 9MHz of all the others, so the two things are probably related.

- The ROM for the uPD7807 is divided in 4 0x10000 banks. The first three just contain a simple sample player, followed by the PCM data. The fourth bank contains the main program. The program literally changes banks under its own feet. However, the portions of code executed while the bank switch happens are identical in all banks, so it still works with MAME's standard MRA_BANK handling.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Return of the Jedi has a peculiar playfield/motion object priority system. That is, there is no priority system. The color of the pixel which appears on screen depends on all three of the foreground, background and motion objects. The 1024 colors palette is appropriately set up by the program to "emulate" a priority system, but it can also be used to display completely different colors (see the palette test in service mode).

TODO:

- There is a custom microcontroller on the original Kangaroo board which is not emulated. This MIGHT cause some problems, but we don't know of any.


NOTES:

- kangaroo: I think there is a bug in the startup checks of the game. At the very beginning, during the RAM check, it goes one byte too far, and ends up trying to write, and re-read, location dfff. To the best of my knowledge, that is a ROM address, so the test fails and the code keeps jumping back at 0000. However, a NMI causes a successful reset. Maybe the hardware generates a NMI short after power on, therefore masking the bug? The NMI is generated by the MB8841 custom microcontroller, so this could be a way to disguise the copy protection. Anyway, what I do here is just immediately generate the NMI, so the game properly starts.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Kangaroo doesn't have color PROMs, the playfield data is directly converted into colors: 1 bit per gun, therefore only 8 possible colors, but there is also a global mask register which controls intensities of the three guns, separately for foreground and background. The fourth bit in the video RAM data disables this mask, making the color display at full intensity regardless of the mask value. Actually the mask doesn't directly control intensity. The guns are rapidly turned on and off at a subpixel rate, relying on the monitor to blend the colors into a more or less uniform half intensity color. We use three groups of 8 pens: the first is fixed and contains the 8 possible colors; the other two are dynamically modified when the mask register is written to, one is for the background, the other for sprites.

NOTES:

- Karnov USA & Karnov Japan and Chelnov USA & Chelnov Japan have different gameplay (!). These games use a 68000 main processor with a 6502, YM2203C and YM3526 for sound.

- Karnov was a major pain to get going because of the 'protection' on the main player sprite, probably connected to the Intel microcontroller on the board. The game is very sensitive to the wrong values at the input ports.

- One of the two color PROMs for chelnov and chelnoj is different. One is most likely a bad read, but I don't know which one.

- Karnov dipswitch: 0x80 called No Die Mode according to the manual, but it doesn't seem to have any effect


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Karnov has two 1024x8 palette PROM. I don't know the exact values of the resistors between the RAM and the RGB output. I assumed these values (the same as Commando).

This write might be what turns the encryption on, but this doesn't explain the encrypted address for the jump.

TODO:

- simpbowl: missing trackball, missing flashrom state saving.

- All games need SPU for sound f/x


NOTES:

- Hardware: Konami GV System (aka "Baby Phoenix") - Arcade PSX

- Simpsons Bowling uses an unknown board revision with 4 x 16M FLASHROMs & a trackball.

- 000180 is used for driving the RGB output. It's a very thin piece of very brittle ceramic containing a circuit, a LM1203 chip, some smt transistors/caps/resistors etc (let's just say placing this thing on the edge of the PCB wasn't a good design choice!) On GV999, it has been replaced by three transistors and a MC44200.

- 056602 seems to be some sort of A/D converter (another ceramic thing containing caps/resistors/transistors and a chip)

- CXD2922 and CXD2925 are SPU's.

- The BIOS on ZV610 and GV999 is identical. It's a 4M MASK ROM, compatible with 27C040.

- The CD contains one MODE 1 data track and several Redbook audio tracks which are streamed to the speaker via CN8.

- The ZV and GV PCB's are virtually identical aside from some minor component shuffling and the RGB output mechanism. However note that the GPU revision is different between the two boards and so are some of the other Sony IC's.

- CN8 used to connect redbook audio output from CD drive to PCB.

- CN6 used to connect power to CD drive.

- CN2 used for extra speaker connection for stereo output.

- CN3, CN5 used for connecting 3rd and 4th player controls.

- 001231, 058239 are PALCE16V8H PALs.

- 10E, 12E are unpopulated positions for 16M TSOP56 FLASHROMs (10E is 9E on GV999).

- If the CD is swapped to another GV game, the game will boot but will stop with an error '25C MBAD' (the EEPROM is 25C). So the games can not be swapped by simply exchanging CDs because the EEPROM will not re-init itself if the CDROM is swapped. This appears to be some form of mild protection to stop operators swapping CD's. However it is possible to swap games to another PCB by exchanging the CD _AND_ the EEPROM from another PCB which belongs to that same game. It won't work with a blank EEPROM or a different games' EEPROM.

- 31st March 2004: smf fixed a bug in the PSX graphics rendering that caused weird graphics in the javelin event in Hyper Athlete.

- 0.80u3: R. Belmont and smf submitted a driver for the Konami GV System. The GV System is identical to a home Playstation/PS1 console, except the CD-ROM is SCSI instead of proprietary. The driver is still in progress: The SPU emulation needs a lot of help, especially on Wedding Rhapsody (smf is working on it), the SCSI CD-ROM emulation needs to be separated out from the AM53cf96 if we ever emulate other SCSI controllers or CD-ROM drives, CHDMAN doesn't output anything useful when you extract a CHD-CD. It should write out a CDRDAO image. And Audio tracks on CDs are not compressed at present (or more accurately they're gzip compressed, which is useless). The plan is to use FLAC at some point.

NOTES:

- To enter service mode in most games, press 1P start and then press the service switch (F2).

- wseries, basebal2, dblplay and strkzone: The controls for these 4 games, while admittedly hard to emulate properly, are either wrong or just confusing. Analog stick 1 does not seem to work when you have to fill out out your initials, or in the latter two, selecting the game mode, but analog stick 2 does, leading me to believe this is a 2 joystick game, and that one side hits and one side pitches. Also, on the batters side, I might be mistaken, but the controls are not read properly. Granted, emulating a spring loaded bat is not going to be simple, but in MAME, the motions of right and/or left (from what I've gathered) on Analog stick 1 does the job of hitting. On a real machine, I recall that you pulled the joystick down and released it to hit, and I don't recall having to load it to the side. This might cause problems with the height adjuster, but I'm sure that, in its most emulable form, you should be hitting while pressing down (or up if required). I rigged up the controls for these games to my computer in my Mame cab. With a little bit of control mapping the controls work perfectly. It will always be a bug if you are trying to use a regular joystick. The "batting" control is an analog joystick placed on it's side so if you used an ordinary PC joystick you would move "left/right" to aim "up/down" and "forward/back" to swing the bat. The other problem is that the joysticks are spring-loaded so that the resting position is forward instead of being centered like a PC joystick. So, I mean, you can play it with a PC joystick, but it's going to feel like the driver was written by a clown when in fact, it works like the original arcade machine. The only issue if you are using the original controls is that the directions need to be remapped. jerryjanis


SOUND HARDWARE NOTES:

- 1st generation sound hardware was controlled by the master Z80. It drove an AY-8910/AY-8912 pair for music. It also had two DACs that were driven by the video refresh. At the end of each scanline there are 8-bit DAC samples that can be enabled via the output ports on the AY-8910. The DACs run at a fixed frequency of 15.3kHz, since they are clocked once each scanline.

- 2nd generation sound hardware was used in Redline Racer. It consisted of an 80186 microcontroller driving 8 8-bit DACs. The frequency of the DACs were controlled by one of 3 Intel 8254 programmable interval timers (PITs). The clock outputs for each DAC can be read, and are polled to determine when data should be updated on the chips. The 80186's two DMA channels are generally used to drive the first two DACs, with the remaining 6 DACs being fed manually via polling.

- 3rd generation sound hardware appeared in the football games (Quarterback, AAFB) and the later games up through Pigout. This variant is closely based on the Redline Racer sound system, but they took out two of the DACs and replaced them with a higher resolution (10-bit) DAC. The driving clocks have been rearranged a bit, and the number of PITs reduced from 3 to 2. Like the 2nd generation board, the first two DACs are driven via the DMA channels, and the remaining 5 DACs are polled.

- 4th generation sound hardware showed up in Ataxx, Indy Heat, and World Soccer Finals. For this variant, they removed one more PIT and 3 of the 8-bit DACs, and added a YM2151 music chip and an externally-fed 8-bit DAC. The externally driven DACs have registers for a start/stop address and triggers to control the clocking.

NOTES:

- Boardinfo and roms: Mike Dailly

- Prototype! Licensed from the home computer version this game never made it past the arcade field test stage. Unlike most Data East games this hardware features a pixel layer and a VRAM layer, probably to make the transition from the pixel addressable computer code to the arcade hardware.

- As prototype software it seems to have a couple of non-critical bugs, the palette ram check and vram check both overrun their actual ramsize.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Liberator's screen is 256 pixels by 256 pixels. The round planet in the middle of the screen is 128 pixels tall by 96 equivalent (192 at double pixel rate). The emulator needs to account for the aspect ratio of 4/3 from the arcade video system in order to make the planet appear round.

TODO:

- SOUND: lots of unknown writes to the YM2203 I/O ports

- Lkage is verfied to be an original set, but it seems to work regardless of what the mcu does. Moreover, the mcu returns a checksum which is different from the one I think the game expects (89, while the game seems to expect 5d). But the game works anyway, it never gives the usual Taito "BAD HW" message.

- Sprite and tilemap placement is most certainly wrong

- Attract mode is bogus (observe the behavior of the player)

- The second stage isn't supposed to have (red) Samurai, only Ninja.

- The final stage is almost impossible in MAME! On the arcade, I could make my way to the top fairly easily, but in MAME I have to use invulnerability.


NOTES:

- Sound section is almost identical to Bubble Bobble, YM2203 instead of YM3526.

- There are actually 1024 colors in paletteram, however, we use a 100% correct reduced "virtual palette" to achieve some optimizations in the video driver.

- Clone lkageb probably uses another MCU dump, which is undumped. MAME use a a fake MCU for it.

- Sky Bumper: This is a ROM swap for Looping. There are two 6116's on the CPU board, where there is only one on Looping.

- Super Tank (C)19?? Venture Line. Runs on simpler hardware; not yet emulated.


Possible Bugs:

- When a balloon appears (or a helicopter in Sky Bumper), the ship slows down a LOT. I'm not sure of the exact speed of the plane in the arcade version of Looping (seems very fast in beta 14 until a balloon appears), but it definitely takes a big hit when a balloon appears. If you destroy the balloon, the plane speeds back up again until another one appears. I can't imagine that being correct behavior for that game, but then I've never seen the original arcade game (just the Colecovision version, where the plane moves a bit slower than the fastest speed seen there, but never slows down when balloons appear). Those speed changes make the game very difficult to play. loopingc37b14gre PacDude


WIP:

- 29th January 2001: Phil Stroffolino sent in the playable Looping driver, with correct graphics and colors, but it lacks one of the nicest features of the game - speech and music. The COP420 microcontroller in fact helps with the CPU communication, so it is probably necessary for sound emulation.

- 28th January 2001: Phil Stroffolino made a big step forward with the Looping driver. While the game is definitely not playable yet, at least the title screen shows up.

-  1st November 2000: Phil Stroffolino started on a Looping driver, it runs I/O CPU code fine now but main CPU code does not seem to be valid and the microcontroller isn't emulated, so nothing works.

TODO:

- I think storming is supposed to be a bootleg without mcu, so I should verify if it works with the mcu not hooked up.

- Wrong sprite/tilemap priority. Sprites can appear above and below the middle layer, it's not clear how this is selected since there are no free attribute bits. The priority seems to involve split transparency on the tilemap and also priority on sprites (so that people pass below doors but airplanes above). It is confirmed that priority is controlled by PROM a64-06.9 (grounding A9 makes sprites disappear).

- Scrollram not entirely understood - it's most likely wrong, but more than enough to run this particular game.

- The video driver is pretty slow and could be optimized using temporary bitmaps (or tilemaps), however I haven't done that because the video circuitry is not entirely understood and if other games are found running on this hardware, they might not like the optimizations.

NOTES:

- avengers061gre2: corrupted graphics in Avengers' ending not fixed. This bug is not in the Japanese set "Buraiken". It might just be a bug in the original: the tiles for the character image are just not present in the US version, replaced by more tiles for the title animation. The tile map ROM is the same between the two versions.

- trojan37b1gre: stage 2-1 boss x flip glitches not fixed. This could be a side effect of sprite RAM buffering. Suggest buffering on-screen content instead of sprite memory.

- Previous clock settings were too low. Sometimes Avengers and Trojan could not finish clearing VRAM before a new frame is drawn and left behind screen artifacts. Avengers' second CPU was forced to pre-empt during soundlatch operations, resulting in double or missing sound effects.

- Avengers runs on hardware almost identical to Trojan, but with a protection device and some small changes to the memory map and videohardware. Background colors are fetched 64 bytes at a time and copied to palette RAM.

They say "kanfu master" instead of "kung-fu master" on the introduction screen, the only original doing that is spartanx but the ROMs don't match after the copyright notice.

TODO:

- majtitle_gfx_ctrl_w is unknown, it seems to be used to disable rowscroll, and maybe other things.

- Maybe there is a layer enable register, e.g. nspirit shows (for an instant) incomplete screens with bad colors when you start a game.

- A lot of unknown I/O writes from the sound CPU in Pound for Pound.

- The sprite chip triggers IRQ1 when it has finished copying the sprite RAM to its private buffer. This isn't implemented (all games have an empty IRQ1 handler). The cpu board also has support for IRQ3 and IRQ4, coming from the external connectors, but I don't think they are used by any game.


NOTES:

- Driver by Nicola Salmoria and protection information by Nao.

- The driver supported IREM M72, M73, M81, M82, M84 and M85 board games. X Multiply (M72) has different addressing PALs, so different memory map. rtype2j has M84 written on the board, but it's the same hardware as rtype2. For Gallop (IREM M73) there is also a M84 version.

- Sample playback: In the later IREM games, the sound CPU can program the start offset of the PCM samples, but it seems the earlier games have them hardcoded somewhere (maybe a PROM?). MAME uses tables with the start offset precomputed. They could be built automatically for the most part (00 marks the end of a sample), but some games have holes in the numbering so we would have to do some alterations anyway. The table for Gallop is most likely wrong, and it doesn't play anything anyway, because the NMI handler of the sound CPU consists of just RETN - so it must be using different hardware.


SOUND HARDWARE NOTES:

- All games have a YM2151 for music, and most of them also samples. Samples are not handled consistently by all the games, some use a high frequency NMI handler to push them through a DAC, others use external hardware. In the following table, the NMI column indicates with a No the games whose NMI handler only consists of RETN. R-Type is an exception, it doesn't have a valid NMI handler at all.

Gfx problems at the players information during attract mode in Skins Game *only*, Major Title is fine (that part of attract mode is different). Eeprom load/save not yet implemented - when done, MT2EEP should be removed from the ROM definition.

- Perfect Soliders: Shortly into the fight, the sound CPU enters a tight loop, conitnuously writing to the status port and with interrupts disabled. I don't see how it is supposed to get out of that loop. Maybe it's not supposed to enter it at all?

- Dream Soccer 94: Slight priority problems when goal scoring animation is played.


NOTES:

- Driver: Emulation by Bryan McPhail. Thanks to Chris Hardy and Olli Bergmann.

- Irem Skins Game has an eeprom and ticket payout(?). R-Type Leo & Lethal Thunder have a memory card.

- Many games use raster IRQ's for special video effects: Scrolling water in Undercover Cops and Score display in R-Type Leo. These are slow to emulate, and can be turned on/off by pressing F1 - they are on by default. These raster effects don't work in flipscreen mode.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The Irem M92 video hardware has 3 scrolling playfields (512x512). Each playfield can enable rowscroll, change shape (to 1024x512), be enabled/disabled and change position in VRAM. Tiles can have several priority values, Sprites have 2 priority values and Raster interrupts can be triggered at any line of the screen redraw, typically used in games like R-Type Leo to multiplex the top playfield.


Bugs:

- majtitl2, skingame, and skingam2: A problem with majtitl2, skingame, and skingam2, however, is sprite priority. This is most easily seen after finishing the first hole. The text in the middle of the screen is behind the trees in the background. The green is behind the text and the trees are behind the green. Listed in order that would mean that priorities are text, green, trees, text. Looping priorities! m92c053gre2 Abbe

NOTES:

- Schematics show a palette/work RAM bank selector, but this doesn't seem to be used?

- In Devastators, shadows don't work. Bit 7 of the sprite attribute is always 0, could there be a global enable flag in the 051960? This is particularly evident in level 2 where plane shadows cover other sprites. The priority/shadow encoder PROM is quite complex, however bits 5-7 of the sprite attribute don't seem to be used, at least not in the first two levels, so the PROM just maps to the fixed priority order currently implemented.

- In Devastators, sprite zooming for the planes in level 2 is particularly bad.

TODO:

- Phozon: there appear to be two palette banks (sprites are the same, but characters change from a blue background to brown background). It is not known if and when the alternate palette should be used. The palette select bit might be at address 500E/500F; if that's the case, it is set to 0 on startup and I don't think it's ever set to 1 - which would mean the second bank is not used and colors are right as they are.

- Phozon: one unknown PROM, I don't know what it could be.


NOTES:

- Hardware: The games supported by this driver all run on similar hardware. They can be divided in three "families": 1) Super Pacman, the first version of the board. Pac & Pal and Grobda run on  seemingly identical hardware. The hardware consists of two 6809, and several Namco custom ICs that provide a static tilemap and 2bpp sprites. Grobda is the only Namco game of this era that has speech (just a short sample). At this time, it is still unknown whether the DAC used to play the speech is part of the standard Namco sound hardware, or a quick addition to the base board. 2) Phozon. This game runs on an unique board: the large number of sprites on screen at the same time required a 3rd 6809 to help with the calculations. The sprite hardware is also different from Super Pacman, featuring 8x8 sprites. Despite the hardware differences, the memory map is almost identical to Super Pacman, and that's why it's included in this driver. There is no information about the custom ICs used by this board. The video section is probably more similar to Gaplus than to Supr Pacman: the sprite generator might be a 21XX (though Gaplus doesn't use 8x8 sprites), and the 00XX and 04XX address generators are probably replaced by the single CUS20 (which also handles the flip screen flag). 3) Mappy runs on a revised design of the Super Pacman board, where the 00XX custom is replaced by a 17XX, which provides a scrolling tilemap. The larger tilemap requires more RAM, so the memory map is slightly different. Also, sprites are 4bpp instead of 2bpp, so the final stage of video generation is a little different as well, though the custom ICs are still the same. Dig Dig II and Motos are almost the same, apart from larger ROMs. Tower of Druaga also has 4x the amount of sprite color combinations so is the most different of the four.

- Phozon: completing level 34 (the second round of world 9) causes the game to crash. This seems to be the correct behaviour: there is no data for levels after that one, and using the level select dip switch to jump to level 35 (="22") causes the same crash. I think being able to complete level 34 is a bug, it should be impossible because there shouldn't be anouth molecules so you would play it forever.

- Phozon: if you enter service mode and press press service coin something like the following is written at the bottom of the screen: 99,99999,9999,9999,9999 - 99,99999,9999,9999,999999 it seems to be a counter decremented while the game is running.

- Mappy: similarly, if you enter service mode and press press P1 button + service coin the following is shown: 99.99.999.9999.9999.9999 - 99.99.999.9999.9999.0000

- Tower of Druaga: keep button 1 pressed while pressing the start button to continue the previous game; you can choose which level to start from.

- Grobda: when the Level Select dip switch is On, after inserting a coin press button + start to be asked the level to start from.

- The only difference between "grobda2" and "grobda3" is a tiny patch to some code related to player shoots handling. Bugfix, I guess.

- Dig Dug II: when the "freeze" dip switch is on, at the beginning of the game select starting level with joystick up/down, then press button 2. During the game, press start to pause/resume.


WIP:

- 0.78u4: Nicola Salmoria merged grobda.c, phozon.c and superpac.c with mappy.c. Fixed and verified inputs and dip switches for all games, found and documented the Easter eggs in all games except Toy Pop, fixed interrupt and sub cpu reset handling, which caused some games to report errors when entering test mode without resetting, added detailed memory maps where schematics allowed, all drivers converted to tilemaps, cocktail mode in Phozon, and non-hack implementation in Gaplus, fixed priorities in superpac. With the previos code, ghost eyes had priority over everything else, even other sprites, giving wrong results when two ghosts overlapped, round advance dip switch in Gaplus available & working and fixed a missing sound effect in Phozon that nobody would have ever noticed. Implements the 56XX and 58XX I/O custom chips (machine/namcoio.c) used by all the games. The I/O chips are now accurately simulated, fixing subtle nuances during normal operation and not-so-subtle ones in test mode; e.g. you can now scroll the grid in Mappy's test mode.

Additionally, the palette is stored differently. I'm also not sure that the 2nd tile page is really used in Mysterious Stones.

- Mat Mania is unusual in that it has both PROMs and RAM to control the palette. PROMs are used for characters and background tiles, RAM for sprites. I don't know for sure how the PROMs are connected to the RGB output, but it's probably the usual.

The ones with bookkeeping or software dips don't USE the SAVED(?) data; the load/save routine in mcr3.c seems a little strange as it's only loading/saving video ram instead of what's listed as nvram in the commented memory map. These games work fine with Mame 0.57. Update: When in DIP settings, and I change the coin to accept 1 coin for 1 credit for both chutes, it is not saving it.

TODO:

- There's a 512 byte PROM in the video section (different for every game) that controls the priorities. It's been dumped for only a few games, so we have to use fake data for the missing ones.

- Making the M6295 status register return 0 fixes the music tempo in avspirit, 64street, astyanax etc. but makes most of the effects in hachoo disappear! Define SOUND_HACK to 0 to turn this hack off. This seems to be some Jaleco magic at work (strange protection?). The bootleg version of rodlandj has one instruction patched out to do exactly the same thing that we are doing (ignoring the 6295 status).

- Iganinju doesn't work properly: I have to patch lev3 irq and it severely slows down at times. Strangely, it gets *better* by lowering the main CPU clock from 12 to 7 MHz. This is likely an interrupt timing issue: changing the order in interrupt_A() from 3 2 1 to 1 2 3 makes it work reasonably well for a very short while.

I think that when tiles are 16x16 a layer can be made of 16x2, 8x4, 4x8 or 2x16 pages (see below). When tile size is 8x8 we have two examples to guide the choice:

NOTES:

- 4 players mode is not emulated. THis involves some shared RAM and a subboard. There is additional code for a third Z80 in the bootleg version, I don't know if it's related or if its just a replacement for the 68705.

- kicknrun does a PS4 STOP ERROR short after boot, but works afterwards. PS4 is the mcu.

- kikikai sometimes crashes, might be a synchronization issue


NOTES (Acho A. Tang):

- Part of Kiki's code runs straight across banked ROM boundaries which MAME's current memory model doesn't seem to handle very well. The result is garbage being executed and thus the game crashes. This can be avoided by preloading bank zero into its default location.

- Kiki Kaikai also suffers from random lock-up's. It happens when the sound CPU misses CTS from YM2203. The processor will loop infinitely and the main CPU will in turn wait forever. It's difficult to meet the required level of synchronization but we can filter the 2205's busy signal.

- Collision is not working on some sprites and the exact reason is unknown.

- Modified VIDEO_UPDATE. The orignal is a Mexico86 duplicate which produces graphics artifacts especially beyond stage 3.

- Rearranged DIP settings according to the Japanese manual.

NOTES.

- Hardware: Midway T-unit system

- The real MK2 board has a special cable designed for SF2 cab conversions that has the 2 SF2 Medium punch/kick buttons as block buttons for MK2. The secondary block button registers in test mode, but does not have an indicator light show up. During gameplay, the second block only functions temporarily. You can hold the button, but the character will only take a block position for 1 second. This is correct behavior.

Other games that might run on this hardware: "Chi-toitsu"(YUGA 1988), Another version of "Mahjong Gakuen" and "MIRAGE Youjyu mahjong den" (MITCHELL 1994).

- Super Pang has a protection which involves copying code stored in the EEPROM to RAM and execute it from there. The first time the game is run, you have to keep the player 1 start button pressed until the title screen appears. This forces the game to initialize the EEPROM, otherwise it will not work. This is simulated with a kluge in input_r.

Enemies coming out of the jail cells in the last stage have wrong priority. Could be tile priority or the typical "small Z, big pri" sprite masking trick currently not supported by K053247_sprites_draw().

- Moo (bootleg): No sprites appear, and the game never enables '246 interrupts. Of course, they're using some copy of a '246 on FPGAs, so who knows what's going on...

- Bucky: Shadows sometimes have wrong priority. (unsupported priority modes). Gaps between zoomed sprites. (fraction round-off). Rogue sprites keep popping on screen after stage 2. They can usually be found near 950000 with sprite code around 5e40 or f400. The GFX viewer only shows blanks at 5e40, however. Are they invalid data from bad sprite ROMs or markers that aren't supposed to be displayed? These artifacts have one thing in common: they all have zero zcode. In fact no other sprites in Bucky seems to have zero zcode.

- Update: More garbages seen in later stages with a great variety. There's enough indication to assume Bucky simply ignores sprites with zero Z. I wonder why nobody reported this.

- Not sure about the main "global brightness" control register, I don't think it can make the palette completely black because of kirarast attract mode, so I'm making it cut by 50% at most.

- gametngk seems to need some kind of shadow sprites but the only difference in the sprite attributes is one of the priority bits, forcing sprites of that priority to be shadows doesn't work

- tetrisp needs shadows as well, see the game selection screen.

- The above might be related to the second "global brightness" control register, which is 000000 in all games except gametngk, tetrisp, tp2m32 and gratia.

- bbbxing: some sprite/roz/bg alignment issues

- gratia: at the beginning of a level it shows the level name in the bottom right corner, scrolling it up and making the score display scroll out of the screen. Is this correct ar should there be a raster effect keeping the score on screen? And why didn't they just use sprites to do that?

- gratia: the 3d sky shown at the beginning of the game has a black gap near the end. It would not be visible if I made the "global brightness" register cut to 100% instead of 50%. Mmmm...

- gratia: the 3d sky seems to be the only place needed the "wrap" parameter to draw_roz to be set. All other games work fine with it not set, and there are many places where it definitely must not be set.

- gratia: at the beginning of the game, before the sky appears, the city background appears for an instant. Missing layer enable register?

- Background color: pen 0 is correct for gametngk, but wrong for f1superb. Maybe it dpeends on the layer priority order?

- roz layer wrapping: currently it's always ON, breaking places where it gets very small so it gets repeated on the screen (p47aces, kirarast, bbbxing, gametngk need it OFF). gratia and desertwr need it ON.

- There are sprite lag issues, but they might be caused by cpu timing so it's better to leave them alone until the CPU clock is correct.

- Hardware: Jaleco MegaSystem 32 - Used by Jaleco in the Mid-90's this system, based on the V70 processor consisted of a two board set up, the first a standard mainboard and the second a 'cartridge'.

- The only difference between the two Gratia sets is in the encrypted ROMs (they use different custom chips). The program is the same.


WIP:

- 13th December 2003: Tomasz Slanina fixed a few things in the Jaleco Mega System 32 driver so that it produces some sound now and partially correct music in most MS32 games (the explosions etc in p47aces and gametngk are fine, which is good because silent shmups suck).

- 12th December  2003: R. Belmont sent in a YMF271 sound core and added it to the Jaleco Mega System 32 driver, but sound doesn't work in it yet. 

- 0.77u3: R. Belmont added YMF271 sound core plus very preliminary hook up in ms32.c (only Desert War makes any sound at all and it doesn't really seem to be anytihng like correct, this is probably due to a combination of z80 communication and banking issues). Added audio Z80 CPU2 (4MHz) and YMF271 stereo sound.

NOTES:

- Driver by David Haywood, Dip Switches and Inputs by Stephane Humbert.

- Mug Smashers is a side scrolling beat-em-up, borrows ideas from Combatribes, including the music (apparently) and sound hardware! There is also a Spanish company logo in the graphic roms. A 1990 copyright can be found in the sound program so its 1990 at the earliest.

- The DSW ports are a bit odd, from reading the test mode it appears the board has 2 physical dipswitches, however these are mapped over multiple real addresses, obviously this gives us two ways of dealing with them, USE_FAKE_INPUT_PORTS is used at compile time to give an option of which behavior we use.

NOTES:

- Hardware: Sega Multi System 32

- Driver: Preliminary support by Jason Lo aka fbff. Based on earlier work by R. Belmont and David Haywood which was in turn based on the Modeler emulator.

- Although the hardware writes to all 65536 colours on both monitors, the games do not use more than 16384 colours per monitor. We discard any colours that are written above MAX_COLOURS(16384).

The old set thrashes the Y register, the new one saves in on the stack. The newer set also resets the sound chips more often.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- There are only a few differences between the video hardware of Mysterious Stones and Mat Mania. The tile bank select bit is different and the sprite selection seems to be different as well.

A few features that have been missing in Helifire since my last update are back, i.e. the flickering colors when you're shot and the volume decay effect (this affects the melody at the start of a game and a few tunes that can be heard during the bonus scenes every twelve attack waves). The starfield should now scroll at the correct speed, it's only 75% of what it used to be. Finally, Stefan decided to use the color prom from Space Fever in Space Launcher (correct?).

- Is view area controlled by registers?

- Xday 2: Has some graphics glitches (wrong sprite tiles); probably blitter-related input ports are wonky; can add "coins" while in free-play mode, but can't start game.


NOTES:

- NA-2 is backwards compatible with NA-1.

- NA-2 games use a different MCU BIOS

- Test mode for NA2 games includes an additional item: UART Test. No games are known to actually link up and use the UART feature. It's been confirmed that a Numan Athletics fails the UART test, behaving as it does in MAME.

- Quiz games use 1p button 1 to pick test, 2p button 1 to begin test, and 2p button 2 to exit. Because quiz games doesn't have joystick.

- Almost all quiz games using JAMMA edge connector assign button1 to up, button 2 to down, button 3 to left, button 4 to right. But Taito F2 quiz games assign button 3 to right and button 4 to left.


Bugs:

- all games: The games don't reset properly. namcona1c060red Kale / Darkk / Heihachi_73

- Updated in MAME .66 : cgangpzl and clone work, but the first time you tun it, it hangs on the RAM/ROM test, then if you exit and run it again after cfg/nv files are made, it runs. All other games in this driver no longer crash. namcona1c057red Sixtoe / Karasu / Pika163 / Russ H. / Smitdogg / Luigi30

Fixes the water effects in Outfoxies.  This same feature needs to be folded into System 2 emulation, but I haven't gotten around to it yet and various Mach Breaker-specific hacks for interpretting the ROZ layer registers; these aren't yet fully understood. In particular, the 'Monster Pull' stage is missing a '3d floor'. Correct 68EC020 CPU1 clock speed to 24.192 MHz and monitor/video frequency to 59.700001 Hz.

- I noticed that some of the System 12 games run slower than they should at 100% emulated speed. The Tekken3 and Ehrgeiz attract modes are good examples of it. During the Tekken3 attract Paul throws someone over his shoulder, and in MAME it goes very slowly(even though frame counter is between 95-100%), but the real board is very fast during that part. In Ehrgeiz, the matches are much slower than the PSX counterpart(I haven't seen an arcade version). I really doubt Namco/Square would speed the game up so dramatically for the home version...

TODO:

- Sprite/tilemap orthogonality needed

- Bad road colors in Final Lap and Suzuka series

- Final Lap: Sprite size bit is bogus during splash screen

- Final Lap2: Sprite ROMs need to be (re)dumped

- Final Lap 3: Bad steering, uses unaligned 32x32 sprites, which aren't handled correctly in vidhrdw/namcos2.c yet

- Four Trax: Sprite banking (for rear view mirror) isn't working

- Suzuka 8 Hours II: Some sprite cropping issues

- Legend of Valkyrie: Gives ADSMISS error on startup

- Dragon Saber: Has garbage ROZ layer spinning in the background of lava level (see attract mode)

- Bubble Trouble (Golly Ghost II): Not dumped


SETUP:

- How to calibrate the guns: hold 9, press f2 and shoot at the targets it shows using the crosshair, after you've shot the target press 9 again to move onto the next one. Once you get back to the start again press f2 to exit.


NOTES:

- Hardware: The Namco System II board is a 5 ( only 4 are emulated ) CPU system. The complete system consists of two boards: CPU + GRAPHICS. It contains a large number of custom ASICs to perform graphics operations, there is no documentation available for these parts. The system is extremely powerful and flexible. A standard CPU board is coupled with a number of different graphics boards to produce a system.

- Final Lap 1-4 cabinets may be wired together. To move through self test options, press gas pedal and change gear shift from low to high. To change an option, move gear shift from low to high without touching the gas pedal.


Bugs:

- In several Namco System 1/2 games there appear to be rough transitions from one screen to another. For the duration of a few frames you can watch the game re-arranging its bitmaps and color palette. Examples include dsaber (between title and game screen), valkyrie (between title and game screen), blastoff (between stage 1-2 and 1-3) or berabohm (in the transition in between any 2 scenes there is corruption and you can see some backgrounds behind them). See this example from dsaber. Also affects ws. namcosx36rc2gre Frotz / Sixtoe and others

TODO:

- ROLT (roll type) specifies the order in which rotation transformations should be applied, i.e. xyz or xzy (matrix multiplication is not associative). The current meaning of ROLT seems to be consistant across System21 games, and even System22.

- The priority between polygons and sprites is currently hard-coded.

- In StarBlade, the sprite list is stored at a different location during startup tests.

- Starblade has some missing background graphics (i.e. the spaceport runway at beginning of stage#1, various large startship cruisers drifting in space, etc. The main CPU doesn't write descriptors for these objects in its display list, nor does it write any obvious "high level commands" to control background graphics sequencing.

- Starblade's EPROM may be incorrect.

- Starblade may require the use of custom MCU code.

- Starblade's point ROMs frequently contain an apparently garbage value in the most significant byte, but the ROMs have been confirmed to be good.  We currently apply a heuristic at runtime to try and correct for it, and don't see any obvious problems. For the polygon data, it is almost invariably just sign extension bits, that can be computed from the middle byte.

- Starblade (and other games) write a lot of data/code to the DSP processors on startup.  Once it is disassembled and understood, it may be possible to insert a trojan to fetch the DSP kernel ROM code, and faithfully emulate all aspects of the system.

- Solvalou does some interesting communication with the DSP processors on startup, and refuses to run if a problem occurs.  The routines testing the return code have been patched out for now.

- CyberSled appears to use the "POSIRQ" feature seen in various Namco System 2 games for split screen effects.  This IRQ is triggered at a designated scanline. It's purpose in CyberSled is unknown.

- There appears to be support for at least 16 levels of lighting for the flat-shaded polygons. The palette is organized into multiple banks, that differ only in respect to shading.  If Namco System22 is any indication, it's likely that System21 has a light vector encoded somewhere in the camera attributes.

- Lamps/vibration outputs are not yet mapped



NOTES:

- Hardware: There are at least three hardware variations, all of which are based on Namco System2: 1. Winning Run was a mass-produced prototype; it uses 3 68k CPUs, 2. Cyber Sled uses 4xTMS320C25 and 3. Starblade uses 5xTMS320C20.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Namco System 21 Video Hardware: Sprite Hardware is identical to Namco System NB1, there are no tilemaps and polygons are drawn by DSP processors.

- The main CPUs populate a chunk of shared RAM with an object display list. The object display list contains references to specific 3d objects and their position/orientation in 3d space.

- The main CPUs also specify attributes for a master camera which provides additional (optional) global transformations.


WIP:

- 0.78u5: System 21 updates: Phil Stroffolino hooked up preliminary support for System21's "depth bias" feature, used as a corrective factor when sorting polygons by representative z value. It's not perfect, but a step in the right direction, improved polygon colors in CyberSled, better parsing of CyberSled's display list; title screen and ingame graphics now appear and are mostly correct, hooked up CyberSled input ports; they can be configured with the usual mechanism: hold the 'service' key while flipping the test dipswitch, added near-plane clipping for System21's flat-shaded polygons, hooked up the view transform, used in Starblade to tilt the screen when player is targeting the edges of the playfield, hooked up a private (placeholder) implementation of zdrawgfx() for C355 sprite rendering, adding sprite-tilemap orthogonality for all games using that chip.  This fixes MAMEtesters bug ptblank056gre, C355 sprite rendering no longer relies on game-specific hacks for XY placement or cropping, some rudimentary work has been done for "Winning Run '91"; this game runs on prototype System21 hardware, and as such is quite different from the other titles.  It uses a 3rd 68k CPU to render graphics to a bitmap layer (there is no sprite chip), but still appears to rely on DSPs for 3d graphics and updated System21 notes/comments.

- 0.78u3: Aaron Giles fixed the PROGRAM_WRITE16_MAP, it crached in 0.78u2.

- 21st October 2002: Aaron Giles fixed some crashes that happened in the Namco 3D games.

- 15th October 2002: Aaron Giles converted the Namco 3D graphics emulation to use the generic triangle setup routines.

- 24th August 2002: Phil Stroffolino submitted the Namco System 21 and 22 drivers. Starblade and Solvalou are playable though missing some background graphics, the rest suffer from various problems.

- 23rd August 2002: Phil Stroffolino reported some progress with the Namco System 21 driver, which supports Starblade, Air Combat, Cyber Sled and Solvalou. All games have full sound support thanks to R. Belmont. Starblade is fully playable, but the other games are preliminary and suffer from various graphics glitches and lack of input ports.

-  6th July 2002: Phil Stroffolino updated the Namco System 21 driver, but the 3D graphics remain unemulated.

- 11th September 2001: Phil Stroffolino reported some progress with the Namco System 2 driver, specifically the sprites are now perfect but the road is not yet working.

-  8th September 2001: Phil Stroffolino improved the Namco System21 driver, but it is still far from perfect.

- 30th August 2001: Phil Stroffolino and Aaron Giles added preliminary polygon support to the Namco System 21 driver, but the transformation matrix and projection parameters are not yet correct.

- 22nd July 2001: Phil Stroffolino sent in some work-in-progress drivers including Namco System 21, which is coming along nicely minus the 3D graphics.

- Time Crisis: No collision detection and force feedback for gun

- Prop Cycle: Motor output: fan, blows air towards player when flying fast, lamp output: start button can light up, steering yoke should be analog and could use a new analog input port type for pedal speed. The "dipswitch" settings are ignored - this isn't a bug.  The Prop Cycle software explicitly clears the chunk of work RAM used to cache the 8 bit dipswitch value immediately after populating it.  This is done to hide secret debug routines from release versions of the game. When the red namco logos slides in from top right and bottom left during splash screen, it is supposed to be translucent with respect to the polygon layer.

TODO:

- The two unknown writes for the MCU are probably watchdog reset and irq acknowledge, but they don't seem to work as expected. During the first few frames they are written out of order and hooking them up in the usual way causes the MCU to stop receiving interrupts.

- rthundro crashes often after you die; I've seen this happen only in area 5, though.

- Spriteram buffering fixes sprite lag, but causes a glitch in rthunder when entering a door. The *closed* door is made of tiles, but the *moving* door is made of sprites. Since sprites are delayed by 1 frame, when you enter a door there is one frame where neither the tile-based closed door nor the sprite-based moving door is shown, so it flickers. Given the experience with Baraduke, where a glitch like this is apparent in the floor 6 boss, this could very well be a bug in the original; if it isn't, I wouldn't know how to fix it.

- In wndrmomo, nothing happens when setting the service mode dip switch while the game is running. This is unusual for Namco. Also, in rthunder it works during attract mode but not while playing. If you set the service switch while playing, it just hangs.

- In hopmappy, when you enter service mode the screen is flipped. Toggling the flip screen dip switch corrects the problem. It appears that some RAM is cleared after the routine that sets the screen orientation is called, while it should be cleared before. I'm not sure if this is a bug in the original, it could be a timing issue in the driver.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Rolling Thunder has two palette PROMs (512x8 and 512x4) and two 2048x8 lookup table PROMs.


NOTES:

- Hardware: 1986 Namco games

- We are using an unusually high CPU interleave factor (800) to avoid hangs in rthunder. The two 6809 in this game synchronize using a semaphore at 5606/5607 (CPU1) 1606/1607 (CPU2). CPU1 clears 5606, does some quick things, and then increments 5606. While it does its quick things (which require about 40 clock cycles) it expects CPU2 to clear 5607. Raising the interleave factor to 1000 makes wndrmomo crash during attract mode. I haven't investigated on the cause.

- There are two watchdogs, one per CPU (or maybe three). Handling them separately is necessary to allow entering service mode without manually resetting in rthunder and genpeitd: only one of the CPUs stops writing to the watchdog.

- The sprite hardware buffers spriteram: the program writes the sprite list to offsets 4-9 of every 16-byte block, then at the end writes to offset 0x1ff2 of sprite RAM to signal the chip that the list is complete. The chip will copy the list from 4-9 to 10-15 and use it from there. This has not been verified on the real hardware, but it is the most logical way of doing it. Emulating this behaviour and not using an external buffer is important in rthunder: when you insert a coin, the whole sprite RAM is cleared, but 0x1ff2 is not written to. If we buffered spriteram to an external buffer, this would cause dangling sprites because the buffer would not be updated.

TODO:

- Figure out how cocktail/upright mode works


NOTES:

- Driver based largely on MAME's Phoenix driver, since Naughty Boy runs on similar hardware as Phoenix. Thanks to Richard Davies for his Phoenix emulator source.

- Pop Flamer appears to run on identical hardware as Naughty Boy. The dipswitches are even identical. 1st protection relies on reading values from a device at $9000 and writing to 400A-400D (See $26A9). Then value stored in 400C must be xxxx1001 (rrca x 3) or else reset. 2nd protection relies on the values stored in 400A-400D matching $2690+($400E) (Starts at $460). If the values all match then it will jump to 0x0011 instead of 0x0009 (refresh instead of reset).


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Naughty Boy has two 256x4 palette PROMs, one containing the high bits and the other the low bits (2x2x2 color space).

- The Naughty Boy screen is split into two sections by the hardware: NonScrolled and Scrolled. NonScrolled = 28x4 - (rows 0,1,34,35, as shown below) this area is split between the top and bottom of the screen, and the address mapping is really funky. Scrolled = 28x64, with a 28x32 viewport. Each column in the virtual screen is 64 (40h) characters high. Thus, column 27 is stored in VRAm at address 0-3fh, column 26 is stored at 40-7f, and so on. This illustration shows the horizonal scroll register set to zero, so the topmost 32 rows of the virtual screen are shown.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The blitter can copy data both in "direct" mode, where every byte of the source data is copied verbatim to video RAM *twice* (thus doubling the pixel width), and in "lookup" mode, where the source byte is taken 4 bits at a time and indexed though a lookup table.

- Video RAM directly maps to a RGB output. In the first version of the hardware the palette was 8-bit, then they added more video RAM to have better color reproduction in photos. This was done in different ways, which differ for the implementation and the control over pixel color in the two drawing modes.

NOTES:

- blkpnthr: There are sprite priority problems in upper part of the screen, they can only be noticed in 2nd and 4th level. Enemy sprites are behind blue walls 2 level) or metal construction (4 ) but when they get close to top of the screen they go in front of them.

[Shin Emu Keikaku team, AVDB, Bryan McPhail, Fuzz, Ernesto Corvi, Andrew Prime]


NOTES:

- NeoGeo games (at 320 pixel width): Various Scrolling near the screen edges looks incorrect in many games. Check the left side of the screen in lbowling when bowling, kotm when walking to the right. Happens on the real machine, sadly. Check this pic of King of the Monsters MVS. Reznor007

- ragnagrd and stakwin2: When you set the Territory DIP to USA, only PLAYER 1 can play. Player 2 cannot play/inputs do nothing. Not a bug. Inputs work fine, but the coin slots on both ragnard and stakswin2 are not common, i.e. you have to put a coin in coinslot 2 to start a game for the 2nd player, and vice versa. Karasu

- kof98, breakrev, neocup98 and realbout2: Using a usa bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners dont use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. These were the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that. Happens on a real MVS. Razoola


Bugs:

- mslugx, lastbld2, flipshot: The playback function in mslugx,lastbld2 and flipshot doesn't seems to work properly.Minor problem in mslugx(usually it have a fatal error that corrupt all the INP),major in the other two(doesn't playback at all). Update: Also affects breakers and breakrev. neogeoc37b15gre Kale

- Various: Some games show vertical lines when the zoom effect is used. This glitch was fixed and now it's back again, iirc it had something to do with ng_lo.rom. snapshot (black and white image due to another bug) neogeoc061gre Jonemaan


DIP/Input Bugs:

- All games: The '6' key is mapped twice: once for 'COIN2' and once 'Select 1'. neogeo056gra stephh


GRAPHICAL ISSUES :

- Effects created using the Raster Interrupt are probably not 100% correct, e.g.:

- Full screen zoom in trally and tpgolf is broken again :-( I think this was caused by the fix for kof94 japan stage.

- Tests on the hardware show that there are 264 raster lines; however, there are one or two line alignemnt issues with some games, SCANLINE_ADJUST is a kludge to get the alignment almost right in most cases. Some good places to test raster effects handling and alignment: aodk 100 mega shock logo, viewpoin Sammy logo, zedblade parallax scrolling, ridhero road, turfmast Japan course hole 4 (the one with the waterfall) and fatfury3, 7th stage (Port Town). Raster effects are used for the background.

- spinmast uses IRQ2 with no noticeable effect (it seems to be always near the bottom of the screen).

- garoup enables IRQ2 on Terry's stage, but with no noticeable effect. Note that it is NOT enabled in 2 players mode, only vs cpu.

- strhoop enables IRQ2 on every scanline during attract mode, with no noticeable effect.

- Money Idol Exchanger runs slow during the "vs. Computer" mode. Solo mode works fine.

- Full screen zoom has some glitches in tpgolf.

- Gururin has bad tiles all over the place (used to work ..)

- Bad clipping during scrolling at the sides on some games (tpgolf for example).


AUDIO ISSUES :

- Sound (Music) was cutting out in ncommand and ncombat due to a bug in the original code, which should obviously have no ill effect on the real YM2610 but confused the emulated one. This is fixed in the YM2610 emulator.

- Some rather bad sounding parts in a couple of Games (shocktro End of Intro).

- In mahretsu music should stop when you begin play (correct after a continue) *untested*


GAMEPLAY ISSUES / LOCKUPS :

- Viewpoint resets halfway through level 1. This is a bug in the asm 68k core.

- magdrop2 behaves strangely when P2 wins a 2 Player game (reports both as losing)

- popbounc without a patch this locks up when sound is disabled, also for this game 'paddle' conroller can be selected in the setup menus, but Mame doesn't support this.

- ssideki2 locks up sometimes during play *not tested recently, certainly used to*

- 2020bb apparently resets when the batter gets hit by the pitcher *not tested*

- Some games apparently crash / reset when you finish them before you get the ending *untested*

- fatfury3 locks up when you complete the game.


NON-ISSUES / FIXED ISSUES :

- Auto Animation Speed is not quite right in Many Games (mslug waterfalls, some bg's in samsho4, blazstar lev 2 etc.)

- shocktro locking up at the bosses, this was fixed a long long time ago, it was due to bugs in the 68k Core.

- Sound, graphic, the odd game crash & any other strange happenings in kof99p and garoup are probably because these machines are prototypes, the games are therefore not finished. There are 'patched' versions of these romsets available in some locations, however these will not be supported.


OTHER MINOR THINGS :

- 2020bb version display, the program roms contains two version numbers, the one which always get displayed when running in Mame is that which would be displayed on a console. This depends on location 0x46 of nvram. That location is the BIOS "Demo sound" bit ('00' for 'set up in each game' and '01' for 'without'). If you set 0x46 to '01' ALL Demosound (Neo Splash screen and in game attract mode) is off, and version number is 1.32X. If you set 0x46 to '00' and set 0x229 (Demosound bit for the game itself. '00' for 'ON' and '01' for 'OFF') to '01' The Neo splashscreen has sound but the ingame attract mode does not and version is set to 1.32X. So it would seem that 1.32X gets displayed when demosund is off and 1.02C when Demosound is on.

TODO:

- Protection is patched in several games, it's the same chip as Macross/Task Force Harrier so it can probably be emulated. I don't think it's an actual MCU, just some type of state machine (Bryan).

- Input ports in Bio-ship Paladin, Strahl

- Sound communication in Mustang might be incorrectly implemented

- Several games use an unknown (custom?) CPU to drive sound and for protection. In macross and gunnail it's easy to work around, the others are more complex. In hachamf it seems that the two CPUs share some RAM (fe000-fefff), and the main CPU fetches pointers from that shared RAM to do important operations like reading the input ports. Some of them are easily deduced checking for similarities in macross and bjtwin; however another protection check involves (see the routine at 01429a) writing data to the fe100-fe1ff range, and then jumping to subroutines in that range (most likely function pointers since each one is only 0x10 bytes long), and heaven knows what those should do. On startup, hachamf does a RAM test, then copies some stuff and jumps to RAM at 0xfef00, where it sits in a loop. Maybe the RAM is shared with the sound CPU, and used as a protection. We patch around that by replacing the reset vector with the "real" one.

- Cocktail mode is supported, but tilemap.c has problems with asymmetrical visible areas.

- Macross2 dip switches (the ones currently listed match macross)

- Macross2 background is wrong in level 2 at the end of the vertical scroll. The tilemap layout is probably different from the one I used, the dimensions should be correct but the page order is likely different.

- Music timing in nouryoku is a little off.

- DSW's in Tdragon2

- In Bioship, there's an occasional flicker of one of the sprites composing big ships. Increasing CPU speed from 12 to 16 MHz improved it, but it's still not 100% fixed.

NOTES:

- Hardware: Atari "Round"

- Unknown Verify: In several places, the value 1 is stored to the byte at $3fdf1e. A fairly complex subroutine is called, and then $3fdf1e is checked to see if it was set to zero. If it was, "HARDWARE ERROR" is displayed. To avoid this, we just return 1 when this value is read within the range of PCs where it is tested.

- Sprite Cache: Somewhere in the code, if all the hardware tests are met properly, some additional dummy sprites are added to the sprite cache before they are copied to sprite RAM. The sprite RAM copy routine computes the total width of all sprites as they are copied and if the total width is less than or equal to 38, it added a "HARDWARE ERROR" spriteto the end. Here we detect the read of the sprite count from within the copy routine, and add some dummy sprites to the cache ourself if there isn't enough total width.

- Bankswitching: Like the slapstic, the SoS bankswitches memory using A13 and A14. Unlike the slapstic, the exact addresses to trigger the bankswitch are unknown. Fortunately, Off the Wall uses a common routine for the important bankswitching. The playfield data is stored in the banked area of ROM, and by comparing the playfields to a real system, a mechanism to bankswitch at the appropriate time was discovered. Fortunately, it's really basic.

- What number should be returned for the c-chip Z80 interrupt?

- Raine source has standard Asuka/Mofflot sprite/tile priority: 0x2000 in sprite_ctrl puts all sprites under top bg layer. But Raine simply kludges in this value, failing to read it from a register. So what is controlling priority.

- Operation Wolf uses similar hardware to Rainbow Islands and Rastan. The screen layout and registers and sprites appear to be identical. The original game has a c-chip like Rainbow. To emulate this we follow Raine and emulate the extra Z80 from the *bootleg* board, which acts as a substitute c-chip. $800 bytes of the Z80's ram space are shared, mapped to $800 words in the 68000 address space used to access the c-chip.

TODO:

- Light gun interrupt timing is arbitrary.

- Saved states invariably freeze.

- TC0100SCN problem: text vs. bg0/1 offsets are wrong: first level wants bg0 4 further right. Cut screens (all?) want bg0 4 pixels further left. But the bg0 x scroll value is zero in both cases! (and the code setting it is a CLR, so there's no doubt it's meant to be).

- There are no set bits in the TC0100SCN ctrl regs which might be causing this. So I'm mystified. (Maybe it's related to game being ORIENTATION_FLIP_X ??)

- DIPs


NOTES:

- Driver based on F2 driver and Raine source.

- Hardware: Operation Thunderbolt operates on hardware very similar to the Taito Z system, in particular the game Spacegun. The lightgun hardware in these two (as well as the eerom and calibration process) looks identical. The game has 4 separate layers of graphics - one 64x64 tiled scrolling background plane of 8x8 tiles, a similar foreground plane, a sprite plane, and a text plane with character definitions held in ram. The sprites are 16x8 tiles aggregated through a spritemap rom into 64x64 zoomable sprites. The main difference is that Operation Thunderbolt uses only a single 68000 CPU, whereas Spacegun has twin 68Ks. (Operation Thunderbolt has a Z80 taking over sound duties, which Spacegun doesn't.)

[Ernesto Corvi]


NOTES:

- Protection: The game uses a Hitachi HD63701 MCU. The program is divided in two parts, the first is contained in a rom of the MCU and the other one is in an external ROM.

- Is there a service mode Easter egg? Maybe with this game they stopped putting them in, because I haven't found them in the later games either (skykid, drgnbstr, etc.)

- Sprites cover the top and bottom non-scrolling portions of the fg. This includes the cookie cut light in round 19, which makes text disappear from those areas. This looks odd, but it's the correct behaviour verified on the real hardware.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Sprite/tile priority is quite complex in this game: it is handled both internally to the CUS29 chip, and externally to it. The bg tilemap is always behind everything. The CUS29 mixes two 8-bit inputs, one from sprites and one from the fg tilemap. 0xff is the transparent color. CUS29 also takes a PRI input, telling which of the two color inputs has priority. Additionally, sprite pixels of color >= 0xf0 always have priority. The priority bit comes from the tilemap RAM, but through an additional filter: sprite pixels of color < 0x80 act as a "cookie cut" mask, handled externally, which overload the PRI bit, making the sprite always have priority. The external RAM that holds this mask contains the OR of all sprite pixels drawn at a certain position, therefore when sprites overlap, it is sufficient for one of them to have color < 0x80 to promote priority of the frontmost sprite. This is used to draw the light in round 19. The CUS29 outputs an 8-bit pixel color, but only the bottom 7 bits are externally checked to determine whether it is transparent or not; therefore, both 0xff and 0x7f are transparent. This is again used to draw the light in round 19, because sprite color 0x7f will erase the tilemap and force it to be transparent.

- Pacland has one 1024x8 and one 1024x4 palette PROM; and three 1024x8 lookup table PROMs (sprites, bg tiles, fg tiles). The palette has 1024 colors, but it is bank switched (4 banks) and only 256 colors are visible at a time. So, instead of creating a static palette, we modify it when the bank switching takes place.

- The mystery items in Ali Baba don't work correctly because of protection

- Make Trax has a "Special" chip that it uses for copy protection. In practical terms, it reads from Special when it reads from location $5040-$50FF.

- The piranha board has a sync bus controler card similar to Midway's pacman. It stores the LSB of the interupt vector using port 00 but it alters the byte to prevent it from running on normal pacman hardware and vice versa. Naughty Mouse uses the same board as Piranha with a different pal to encrypt the vectors. Incidentally we don't know the actual name of this game.  Other than the word naughty at the top of the playfield there's no name.  It shares some character data with the missing game Woodpecker, they may be related.


Bugs:

- pacman.c pacman.c notes: Here are some notes about pacman.c from dwidel: Pacmod (harder?): Not harder, has a patch to remove checksum failure, changes copyright to 1981, changes nickname to ghost. Pacgal: I have 4 pacgal boards, they all use the normal 4a not the crush roller 4a. Also the only significant difference between pacgal and the mspac bootleg is the name change and removal of "Midway Mfg Co". It should probably be removed under the current policy of culling redundant bootlegs. Piranha: I have seen lots of these boards and the current roms are not the usual ones. The only version I've seen has Eyes' encryption, different music and intermissions, uses interupt mode 2 and is protected to prevent it being run on a pacman board. The protection is not very good however. pacmanc056ora dwidel

There is a loop at $2002 that reads the player controls -- the game sits in this loop as long as Port B changes. Also, Port B seems to invert the input bits, and the game checks for this at $2f32. The game also uses the RIM instruction a lot, that's purpose is unclear, as the result doesn't seem to be used (even when it's stored, the result is never read again).

TODO:

- bigtwin: The pixel bitmap might be larger than what I handle, or the vertical scroll register has an additional meaning. The usual scroll value is 0x7f0, the game is setting it to 0x5f0 while updating the bitmap, so this should either scroll the changing region out of view, or disable it. During gameplay, the image that scrolls down might have to be different since the scroll register is in the range 0x600-0x6ff. As it is handled now, it is certainly wrong because after game over the bitmap is left on screen.

- wbeachvl: Sprite/tile priority issue during attract mode (plane should go behind palm). The histogram functions don't seem to work. Sound is controlled by a pic16c57 whose ROM is missing for this game.


NOTES:

- Hardware: The games bigtwin and wbeachvl run on different, but similar, hardware. The sprite system is the same (almost - the tile size is different). An interesting thing about this hardware is that the same gfx ROMs are used to generate both 8x8 and 16x16 tiles for different tilemaps.

- Pole Position II reports 'Manual Start' on the Test Mode. This is ok, because they had to accomodate the hardware from Pole Position I to allow track selection.

- Change POLEPOS_TOGGLE to 0 if you are using the original gearshift.

- The old version of the vertical scaling ROM, 136014-131, has (apart from some irrelevant differences) one bad bit. This seems to be a genuine error on Atari's part, since they replaced it with 136014-231 which matches Namco's PP1-27. The bad bit should cause a tiny gfx glitch, though it's difficult to notice.

[Juergen Buchmueller]


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Pong's horizontal counter is made up of two 7493 chips (4 bit binary counters F8 and F9) and a JK flip-flop (74107 F6) for the MSB, whic is bit 8 of the pixel column number. The HRESET signal is generated when counters reached 256+128+64+4+2, that is the pixel clock #454 of a scanline. The HRESET signal is decoded using the eight input NAND gate 7430/F7, three inputs are tied to Vcc and the remaining five are connected to the 256H, 128H, 64H, 4H and 2H outputs. This signal goes to a D-type flip-flop. The raising edge of the clock pulse latches the output of F7 in 7474/E7.2, it's output Q\ is called HRESET. The HRESET goes away at the next clock cycle's raising edge. At the time HRESET is active, there's another flip-flop made from two NAND gates (7400/H5.2 and 7400/H5.3) set to generate the HBLANK signal. This signal remains active until the counter reaches 64+16 (decoded by 7410/G5.2), so the first 80 pixel clocks are invisible/blanked. During the horizontal blanking time, there's the HSYNC signal drived from counter bit 6 (32H), so pixel clocks 0..31 are HBLANK alone, 32..63 HBLANK+HSYNC and 64..79 HBLANK alone again.

- The vertical counter is also made up of two 7493 chips (4-bit binary counters E8 and E9) and a JK flip-flop (74107/D9.2) for the MSB, which is bit 8 of the scanline number. The VRESET signal is generated when counters reached 256+4+1, that is when scanline #261 is being displayed. (This shows that PONG was a horizontal game. Similiar to the HORIZONTAL COUNTER there are really two more VERTICAL SYNC counter values, because VRESET is delayed by the pixel clock: the VRESET signal is decoded using a three input NAND gate (7410/D8.3) and it's inputs are connected to the 256V, 4V and 1V outputs. The clock pulse (HRESET) in scanline 261 latches the output of D8.3 in the D-type flip-flop (7474/E7.1). It's negative output Q\ is called VRESET, very similiar to the horizontal stuff. The VRESET goes away on the next raising edge of the cycle (HRESET going high). At the time VRESET goes active (high), there's another flip-flop made from two NOR gates (7400/F5.3 and 7400/F5.4) set to generate the VBLANK\ signal. This signal remains active until the counter reaches 16, so the first 16 scanlines are invisible/blanked. During the vertical blanking time, there's the VSYNC signal drived from the VERTICAL SYNC counter bits 2+3 (VBLANK and 4V and 8V\), so scanlines 0..3 are VBLANK alone, scanlines 4..7 VBLANK+VSYNC and scanlines 8..15 VBLANK alone again. If you multiply 261 by the 454 pixels per scanline, the pixel clock must have been 7,109,640 Hz for a 60 Hz frame rate. This would mean a crystal with 14,219,280 Hz, but probably it was a standard US TV crystal with 14,318,100 Hz.

- The score for both players is counted using a decade counter plus a JK flip-flop for the 10. There's C7/C8 1st for player 1 and D7/C8 2nd for player two. The two scores are de-multiplexed using two 74153 chips C6/D6. This are four one-of-four de-multiplexers and they select the signals by decoding 32H and 64H signals.

- Pong uses no LED displays, but decodes the horizontal and vertical positions into segments using a whole lotta gates.

- The players pads are two vertical blocks which are four pixels wide and fifteen pixels high. The starting scanline of each pad is derived from a timer, the well known NE555 chip. The paddle inputs are used to fire the players timer after a variable amount of time. These timers are triggered by the -256V signal, which is active hi for scanlines in range from 0 to 255.

[inside out boy]


NOTES:

- A lower interleave causes some sounds to miss, different interleave values change random elements eg position of falling logs, it may be enough to synchronise the cpus on read/writes to the 0xdd00/0f range.

- It's possible that the two score rows shouldn't be overlaid or shouldn't be drawn at all times, the only time there is anything underneath is the colour bars on the startup screen.

- On odd/bonus levels the chars are not aligned with the sprites when the pylons are initially drawn (too low) resulting in the top 3 pylons being black, as the pylons move up the screen the chars go out of alignment again (this time too high) for a single frame to show another glitch.

- Front to back ordering of object/enemy sprites appears wrong.

- On even levels the front most balloon carrying new enemies swaps between the left and middle one, clipping to 16 pixel strips solves this but causes other obvious sprite drawing errors.

- Balloon sprites not displayed on high score entry due to the way videoram is being drawn, possibly trying to create a stencil effect.

- Bursting a balloon on bonus levels just before dying from a log causes a sprite glitch for a few frames and then a 9999 point bonus.

- Reads from 0xffff appear to be a harmless bug in the code that initialises memory blocks for enemies on odd levels, it goes on to read from 0x001f, 0x003f, 0x005f, 0x007f in the rom before giving up.

- A reset while a game is in progress or with credits inserted shows a "sorry!! over run" message instead of the test screen during startup, looks like the game assumes the reset was caused by the watchdog after a hang/crash and is apologising to the player for the loss of their game.

- Title screen sprite colour glitch in lower right corner of the large pylon when an even level was shown before, caused by the game trying to colour the top of the pylon in the same way as for odd levels.

- Enemies stop moving on even levels on rare occasions.

- Enemy sprites entering from the bridges on odd levels are clipped by a few pixels at the top, this would happen even without the overlay as the first few rows of videoram are high priority solid chars most of the time.

- Unknown 0xe002 writes, on for title and level 2 off for all else, looks to be graphic related.

- Bottom of screen is scrappy on odd levels, amongst other things the sprites leave early, screen size could be clipped tighter or there could be some special handling needed, possibly tied to the 0xe002 writes.

- The game freezes in much the same way as the stop dip switch when the coin inputs are high (a short PORT_BIT_IMPULSE duration will still cause a hitch), so potentially there's a coin lockout mechanism.

Also, xscroll values are always the same, maybe the hw can't do simultaneous line/columnscroll. -pjp

- Figure out how the daraku text layers work correctly, dimensions are different (even more tilemaps needed). daraku seems to use tilemaps only for text layer (hi-scores, insert coin, warning message, test mode, psikyo (c)) how this is used is uncertain,

- Flip screen, located but not implemented. wait until tilemaps.

- The stuff might be converted to use the tilemaps once all the features is worked out ... complicated by the fact that the whole tilemap will have to be marked dirty each time the bank changes (this can happen once per frame, unless a tilemap is allocated for each bank. 18 + 9 = 27 tilemaps (including both sizes, possibly another 8 if the large tilemaps can start on odd banks). Would also need to support TRANSPARENCY_ALPHARANGE

NOTES:

- The alternate hardware version is probably earlier than the main set. It looks closer to Dynamite Duke (1989 game), while the main set looks closer to the newer 68000 games in terms of graphics registers used, etc. As well as different graphics registers the alternate set has a different memory map, and different fix char layer memory layout!

- Coin inputs are handled by the sound CPU, so they don't work with sound disabled. Just put the game in Free Play mode.

- The country byte is stored at 0xffffd in the main cpu region, (that's 0x1fffe in program rom 4): 0x80 = World/Japan version? (Seibu Kaihatsu), 0x81 = USA version (Fabtek license), 0x82 = Taiwan version (Liang HWA Electronics license), 0x83 = Hong Kong version (Wah Yan Electronics license) and 0x84 = Korean version (IBL Corporation license). There are also strings for Spanish, Greece, Mexico, Middle & South America though it's not clear if they are used.

- The encryption method is based on code by Niclas Karlsson Mate, who figured it out. The technique is a combination of a XOR table plus bit-swapping.

NOTES:

- The Test Mode "dip switch" actually comes from the edge connector, but is mapped in memory in place of dip switch #8. Dip switch #8 is supposed to freeze the game and is entirely handled by hardware.

- PROM 7a controls the video shape. This is used to hide the rightmost 4 char columns in Locomotion and Commando, while showing them in Jungler and Tactician.

- The playfield scroll registers used in Rally X are present, but not useful (always 0) in Jungler and Tactician. They were removed in Locomotn and Commando.

- commsega has more sprites and more "bullets" than the other games.

- it seems that Jungler doesn't support high priority tiles. Maybe they disabled that feature because they needed more color combinations.

[Zsolt Vasvari]


NOTES:

- Route 16 and Stratovox use identical hardware with the following exceptions: Stratovox has a DAC for voice. Route 16 has the added ability to turn off each bitplane indiviaually. This looks like an afterthought, as one of the same bits that control the palette selection is doubly utilized as the bitmap enable bit.

- Space Echo: When all astronauts are taken the game over tune ends with 5 bad notes, this appears to be a bug in the rom from a changed instruction at 2EB3. Service mode shows a garbled screen as most of the code for it has been replaced by other routines, however the sound tests still work. it's possible that the service switch isn't connected on the real hardware. The game hangs if it doesn't pass the startup test, a best guess is implemented rather than patching out the test. code for the same test is in stratvox but isn't called, speakres has a very similar test but doesn't care about the result. Interrupts per frame for cpu1 is a best guess based on how stratvox uses the DAC, writing up to 195 times per frame with each byte from the rom written 4 times. spacecho writes one byte per interrupt so 195/4 or 48 is used. a lower number increases the chance of a sound interrupting itself, which for most sounds is buggy and causes the game to freeze until the first sound completes.

In the NMI code, the current scanline value is used to calculate the value to put into location $1F in memory. I cheat in this driver by just putting the paddle value directly into $1F, which has the same net result. Mike Balfour

NOTES:

- Moonwar: 8255 Port C bit 4 was originally designed so when bit4=0, 1P spinner is selected, and when bit4=1, 2P spinner gets selected. But they forgot to change the 8255 initialization value and Port C was set to input, setting the spinner select bit to HI regardless what was written to it. This bug has been corrected in the newer set, but, to maintain hardware compatibility with older PCB's, they had to reverse to active status of the select bit. So in the newer set, Bit4=1 selects the 1P spinner and Bit4=0 selects the 2P spinner.

- Armored Car sets Port C as well, but it's input only and the games uses other bits for the 2nd player controls. Maybe the games was meant to use 2 joysticks at one time.

- Calipso was apperantly redesigned for two player simultanious play. There is code at $298a to flip the screen, but location $8669 has to be set to 2. It's set to 1 no matter how many players are playing. It's possible that there is a cocktail version of the game.

- Video Hustler and its two bootlegs all have identical code, the only differences are the title, copyright removed, different encryptions or no encryption, plus hustlerb has a different memory map.

- The game is playable, but: It isn't possible to decrease the bet (but it might be an ingame "feature"), it isn't possible to insert a note and it isn't possible to exchange the winning points against tickets or cash.

- The settings can be modified in the "test mode", but there aren't mapped to input ports.

TODO:

- Still missing hard disks for: Hyperdrive [Seattle, Midway, 200MHz, 8MB RAM, 1xTMU]

- Blitz: Hangs if POST is enabled due to TMU 1 attempted accesses.

- Carnevil: Lets you set the flash brightness; need to emulate that.


WIP:

- 0.82u2: Aaron Giles added more extensive documentation on the various boardsets, constants for the GT64010 and all interrupts and ethernet device interrupt support. Made the IDE controller visible on the PCI bus, formalized support for the "widget" board used in vaportrx & calspeed, hooked up CMOS protection bit, corrected sfrushrk audio CRCs and hooked up hard disk and marked sfrush and vaportrx as working.

- 0.81u6: Aaron Giles added a diagram of interrupt sourcing, fixed incorrect checksums on SF Rush: The Rock audio ROMs, added support for DCS HLE downloading via FIFO (used by Vegas games) and fixed incorrect sound pitch in Blitz 99/2k.

- 0.81u5: Aaron Giles improved VBLANK interrupt handling, cleaned up handling of DMA operations, DMA operations now properly pause if they can't write to the voodoo, now returning proper PCI IDs for the bridge device, mapped more inputs and DIP switches for Biofreaks, fixed clock speed for Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, cleaned up memory maps, added Vapor TRX to the supported games and added entries for Hyperdrive and SF Rush: The Rock (no hard disks ATM).

- 10th April 2004: Aaron Giles added some HLE to the sample upload commands in the DCS2 system, speeding up the Seattle games somewhat.

-  9th April 2004: Aaron Giles fixed the slow booting in the Seattle driver by recent IDE change.

- 0.79u2: Change Custom sound to DMA-driven_DAC.

- 0.78: Aaron Giles added support for Biofreaks, fixed remaining issues in California Speed, verified California Speed HDD dump (works in self test, not in boot ROM test), fixed timer change that broke Blitz 2000 and added proper PIC IDs for Wayne Gretzky and Mace. Midway IC: Added sound auto acknowledgement option, added new PIC mapping for Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and fixed initial sound IRQ state. DCS: Fixed reporting of input full/output empty states.

- 0.77u3: Correct graphics resolution to 512x400 in all games. Aaron Giles included several DIP switch fixes from Brian Troha and made sure the IDE controller waits a minimum amount of time before generating an interrupt. The IDE controller features buffer is now filled in completely. Also fixed code that reads the bus master status register from a word offset.

-  7th December 2003: Aaron Giles added the ADSP2104 variant to the ADSP2100 CPU core, fixed several minor bugs in the Seattle driver that affected Biofreaks and California Speed (but they're still not fully working), added speedups to NFL Blitz and NFL Blitz 2000 and did various other bug fixes and cleanups in the Seattle driver.

- 0.77u1: Roman Scherzer updated a couple of drivers with new Hard Drive SHA1s (cojag.c, djmain.c and seattle.c)

-  5th November 2003: Aaron Giles finally submitted the Seattle driver last night. Not everything's 100%, but 4 games are playable. Well, playable being a relative term for how much you can stand playing games at 20-30% of full speed on a 3GHz machine. Also, I did manage to improve Offroad Challenge... the terrain is correct, but there is still a bug that clips out the cars. CAGE is coming along, but sounds horrible at the moment. But at least San Francisco Rush has some music, if you define music as a random sequence of notes coming out of your speaker at various times.

-  2nd November 2003: Aaron Giles turns out that San Francisco Rush uses the CAGE audio system (shared by Primal Rage and T-Mek), guess he will try to get that working again as well. He's thinking there is a bug in the TMS32C031 core, and he's hoping he can find it so that Offroad Challenge might fall into the playable category as a side-effect. He also continue working on the 3dfx emulation.

- 31st October 2003: Aaron Giles submitted several of the Seattle games. He managed to play all the way through CarnEvil (~50-60% full speed on my 3GHz machine and that's the fastest Seattle game I have). Also got another Seattle game just up and running.

TODO:

- MegaPlay: Other known games: Bio Hazard Battle, Gunstar Heroes, Streets Of Rage 2, Mazin Wars and Grandslam Tennis.

- Puyo Puyo ends up with a black screen after doing memory tests Battery-backed RAM needs to be figured out.


SETUP:

- The fake MegaTech SMS VDP Display can you disable in the dipswitch menu.


NOTES:

- Hardware: Sega System C/C2. Used between 1989 and 1994, the hardware being very similar to that used by the Sega MegaDrive/Genesis Home Console Sega produced around the same time.

- MegaPlay games are modified Genesis games. MegaTech games are Genesis or SMS based games. The game instructions are in the user1 rom 12368-52.ic2. If 52 of the rom 12368-52.ic2 is the game number, then there are a lot of carts, mt_beast is 01 and mt_sonic is 52.

- Driver based on Charles MacDonald C2Emu and help from Mish, Razoola and Antiriad.

- Eng indicates game is in the English Language, Most Likely a European / US Romset Jpn indicates the game plays in Japanese and is therefore likely a Japanes Romset

- Another way to play these games is with Charles Macdonald's C2Emu, which was the inspiration for much of this code. Visit http://cgfm2.emuviews.com for the download, also home of some _very_ good Sega Genesis VDP documentation.

- The ASM 68k Core causes a scoring problem in Columns, Starscream does this also, with the C 68k Core the scoring in columns is correct.

- Bloxeed doesn't Read from the Protection Chip at all; all of the other games do. Currently the protection chip is mostly understood, and needs a table of 256 4-bit values for each game. In all cases except for Poto Poto and Puyo Puyo 2, the table is embedded in the code. Workarounds for the other 2 cases are provided.

- I'm assuming System-C was the Board without the uPD7759 chip and System-C2 was the version of the board with it, this could be completely wrong but it doesn't really matter anyway.

- Vertical 2 Cell Based Scrolling won't be 100% accurate on a line that uses a Line Scroll value which isn't divisible by 8.. I've never seen a C2 game do this tho.


WIP:

- 0.82: David Haywood added various Megatech sets. Note: MegaTech is still marked as NON-WORKING anyway due to bios issues.

- 27th April 2004: Guru - Received about 15 Sega Megaplay carts from B. Simpson.

- 20th April 2004: Barry Rodewald - Fixed SMS VDP Y-Flip (thanks Haze). Golden Axe II now starts and is playable. The Megatech version of Golden Axe II should be startable now too, I have no idea where that fix went, but it's in there now. I'll fix it up to be the same as for Megaplay eventually, but this will do for now. Current issues: How the BIOS tells the 68000 to reset has yet to determined. Games can go quite nutty after exiting from test mode, especially after the memory test. Continuing without any credits in Sonic and Golden Axe II. Tecmo World Cup is fine here as for this game, the BIOS controls the continue functions. Golden Axe II reads the amount of credits from 0xa02001 - just how that gets there is something to still figure out...

- 19th April 2004: Barry Rodewald - In-game DIP switches now work in Golden Axe 2. Instructions appear. One more test passes. Only one more to figure out (IC-3 is only marked bad because of the startup kludge). Still many things to do. Like cleaning up the driver, and splitting Megatech/Megaplay from the C2 driver. Sounds like work.

- 18th April 2004: Barry Rodewald - Sonic and Tecmo World Cup now coin up and run demos at the right time. You can start them also.

- 0.81u5: Barry Rodewald improved Megaplay, allowing it to pass more checks. Added second SN76496 to the MegaTech and MegaPlay games.

-  7th April 2004: Barry Rodewald - Memory test now is completed. IC-3, IC-37, and IC-36 come up bad still. Must investigate this further. Also added the second SN76489 (part of the SMS VDP). Now you get a sound when you insert a credit.

- 0.73: Barry Rodewald continued MegaPlay improvements (still none fully working yet but more of the bios menu tests pass now).

- 0.72u2: Barry Rodewald improved Megaplay a bit, the bios screens now show however the games still don't work.

- 0.72: Correct graphics resolution to 320x416 and aspect ratio from 4:3 to 4:6. Barry Rodewald and David Haywood made improvements to Megatech emulation, although its still far from being correct and still under development, will be split from segac2.c once finished.

- 31st July 2003: Barry Rodewald submitted another bunch of random improvements to the Sega Mega-Tech driver.

- 28th July 2003: Barry Rodewald submitted various improvements to the Sega Mega-Tech driver.

- 0.71u2: David Haywood made some progress on MegaTech emulation menu is now displayed, but carts not recognised, display currently controllled by a dipswitch, will be changed later, enabled the other games on the driver while work is done, these might be disabled for 0.72.

- 0.71u1: Started adding support for Megatech, first step is improving the Genesis Emulation. The rendering will also need improving to support mid-frame palette changes. (RGB_DIRECT) maybe use tilemaps if its not too messy, added Genesis sound based on Mess code.

- 0.53: Correct palettesize from 6144 to 2048 colors.

-  5th March 2001: David Haywood added state saving to the Sega C2 driver, fixed some small bugs in it.

-  7th February 2001: David Haywood added a Tant-R bootleg romset to the Sega C2 driver.

- 0.37b10: Correct 68000 CPU1 clock speed to 7670442 Hz, SN76496 to 3579540 Hz and in the System C-2 games the uPD7759 to 3835221 Hz.

- 16th November 2000: Aaron Giles fixed some opcode bugs in the ASM 68k core, and he cleaned up the Sega C2 driver.

- Many thanks go to Dave Fish for the fine detective work he did into the G-80 security chips (315-0064, 315-0070, 315-0076, 315-0082) which provided me with enough information to emulate those chips at runtime along with the 315-0062 Astro Blaster chip and the 315-0063 Space Odyssey chip.

- Special note (24-MAR-1999) - Sindbad Mystery does *not* use the standard G-80 security chip; rather, it uses the Sega System 1 encryption.

- Thanks also go to Paul Tonizzo, Clay Cowgill, John Bowes, and Kevin Klopp for all the helpful information, samples, and schematics!


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The Sega raster games don't have a color PROM. Instead, it has a color RAM that can be filled with bytes of the form BBGGGRRR. We'll still build up an initial palette, and set our colortable to point to a different color for each entry in the colortable, which we'll adjust later using palette_set_color.

NOTES:

- Driver by David Haywood, Charles Macdonald for docmentation of the SMS VDP Chip used on this system, Mike Beaver for Mimic, although not used as a reference, it was used as an inspiration & motivation and Stphane Humbert for dipswitch information.

- Sega System 'E' is a piece of hardware used for a couple of Arcade Games produced by Sega in the Mid 80's, its roughly based on their Sega Master System home console unit, using the same '315-5124' VDP (actually in this case 2 of them)

- An interesting feature of the system is that the CPU is contained on the ROM board, the MAIN System E board contains the Graphics processor, this opens the possibility for using processors other than the Standard Z80 to run the main game code on, an option which they appear to have made use of for a couple of the titles unless of course the roms are simply bad dumps.

- Also interesting is each VDP has double the Video RAM found on the SMS console this is banked through Port Writes, the System also allows for the Video RAM to be written directly, bypassing the usual procedure of writing to it via the '315-5124' data port, it can not however be read directly, the same area used for writing is used to access banked ROMs when reading.

- Pretty much everything on this hardware is done through port accesses, the main memory map consists of simply ROM, BANKED ROM / BANKED RAM, RAM

- Viper Phase 1: OLD version (viperp1o) Game locks up / crashes after a few attract loops (386 writes to z80 fifo with data read from unmapped addresses in steps of 0x20000 past the end of z80 ram).


NOTES:

- Hardware: Seibu SPI and Seibu SYS386. The SYS386 board seems like a lower-cost version of the single-board SPI. It has a 40MHz AMD 386 and a considerably weaker sound system (dual MSM6295). The SPI system has an Intel 386 DX 25MHz / 33MHz, a Z80 8MHz (sound), YMF271F Sound chip and a Seibu Custom GFX chip.


WIP:

- 0.82u3: Nathan Woods fixed i386 interrupt call to use PULSE_LINE instead of always ASSERT_LINE.

- 0.81u7: Ville Linde added the missing keys to E-Jan. Added layer enable register. Wrote a new i386 disassembler. Dasm386 wasn't always showing stuff correctly, and now the i386 core can be compiled without i86. Preliminary Dallas DS2404 (RTC/CMOS) emulation. Added 93C46 eeprom to RF2 single and RF2 2K. It's not hooked up though. Improved i386/z80 interleaving. This should help with the small pauses. Fixed some stuff in the i386 core. These don't seem to affect the SPI games, but should help with MESS

- 0.81u6: Ville Linde added sprite flipping and other improved sprite processing and corrected palette banking on tilemaps.

- 0.81u5: Ville Linde applied text layer decrypt to the regular tiles, it also improves them a lot, greatly improved tilemap emulation including scrolling, layer disables, etc., improved tilemap emulation further, including tile bank select and palette bank select, supports alternate (older?) video hardware in viperp1 with one fewer tilemap and a different VRAM layout, added mahjong keyboard controller for ejanhs, but it doesn't coin up yet, improved sprite drawing and sound starting to work in the single-board rf2_us.

- 11th April 2004: Ville Linde improved the tilemap emulation further in the Seibu SPI driver, added support for alternate video hardware in Viper Phase 1.

-  6th April 2004: Ville Linde sent in another update to the Seibu SPI driver where Raiden Fighters now runs correctly, but still has encrypted graphics. R. Belmont added the Z80 bankswitching in the Seibu SPI driver, adding sound to some games in that driver.

-  4th April 2004: Olivier Galibert partially decrypted the text layer in the Seibu SPI system.

- 28th March 2004: Ville Linde submitted an i386 CPU core and a Seibu SPI system driver supporting Senkyu / Battle Balls, Viper Phase 1, E-Jan High School, Raiden Fighters and Raiden Fighters 2 which would be playable but the graphics are encrypted, and the sound is also not emulated.

NOTES:

- Hardware: The board was obviously born to run Senjyo. Four scrolling layers, gradient background, sprite/background priorities, and even a small bitmap for the radar. Star Force uses only a small subset of the features.

- Senjyo: The driver must avoid generating interrupts for the first few frames otherwise Senjyo locks up. There must be an interrupt enable port somewhere, or maybe interrupts are genenrated by the CTC. Maybe a write to port d002 clears the IRQ line, but I'm not sure.

TODO:

- I think the best way to correctly align tilemaps and sprites and account for both flipping and different visible areas is to have a table with per game vertical and horizontal offsets for sprites, tilemaps and possibly the "floating tilemaps" (made of sprites) for both the flipped and normal screen cases. Current issues: metafox test grid not aligned when screen flipped, madshark & utoukond ("floating tilemaps" sprites when flipped) and krzybowl not aligned vertically when screen flipped.

- Bad sound in sokonuke?

- In msgunda1, colors for the score display screw up after the second animation in attract mode. The end of the animation also has garbled sprites. Note that the animation is not present in msgundam.

- Some games: battery backed portion of RAM (e.g. downtown, kiwame, zombraid)

- The zombraid crosshair hack can go if the nvram regions are figured out.

- Some games: programmable timer that generates IRQ. See e.g. gundhara: lev 4 is triggerd by writes at d00000-6 and drives the sound. See also msgundam.

- tndrcade: lots of flickering sprites

- drgnunit sprite/bg unaligned when screen flipped (check I/O test in service mode)

- extdwnhl has some wrong colored tiles in one of the attract mode images and in later tracks.

- oisipuzl doesn't support screen flip? tilemap flipping is also kludged in the video driver.

- eightfrc has alignment problems both flipped and not

- Flip screen and mirror support not working correctly in zombraid

- gundhara visible area might be smaller (zombraid uses the same MachineDriver, and the current area is right for it)


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Seta Hardware has 2 Scrolling Layers, 1024 Sprites and a Floating Tilemap. Each layer consists of 2 tilemaps: only one can be displayed at a given time (the games usually flip continuously between the two). The two tilemaps share the same scrolling registers.

- mj4simai: test mode doesn't work correctly, the grid is ok but when you press a key to go to the next screen (input test) it stays up a second and then drops back into the game

- myangel: some gfx at the end of the game (rays just before fireworks, and the border during the wedding) have wrong colors. You can see the rays red, green and yellow because that's how the palette is preinitialized by MAME, but the game never sets up those palette entries. The game selects color depth "1", whose meaning is uncertain, and color code 0 so I see no way to point to a different section of palette RAM.

- There are glitches in the bg horizontal scroll in the wedding sequence at the end of the game. It looks like "scrollx" should be delayed one frame wrt "xoffs".

- myangel2: Before each level, the background image is shown with completely wrong colors. It corrects itself when the level starts.

- grdians: The map screen after the character selection needs zooming. There is a global zoom register that should affect the background map and the level picture but not the frontmost frame. This latter should use color 7ff (the last one) and ignore the individual color codes in the tiles data. Zooming is also used briefly in pengbros.


NOTES:

- The Toshiba TMP68301 CPU is a 68HC000 + serial I/O, parallel I/O, 3 timers, address decoder, wait generator, interrupt controller, all integrated in a single chip.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- This newer Seta hardware only generates sprites. But they're of various types, including some large "floating tilemap" ones. Sprites RAM is 0x40000 bytes long. All games write the sprites list at offset 0x3000. Each entry in the list holds data for a multi-sprite of up to 256 single-sprites (see src).

NOTES:

- As for some other M68000 Technos games (or games running on similar hardware such as 'mugsmash'), the Inputs and the Dip Switches are mangled, so you need a specific read handler so end-uers can see them in a "standard" order. IMO you should set the USE_SHADFRCE_FAKE_INPUT_PORTS macro to 1.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Custom blitter GA9201 KA01-0249 (120pin IC): This is a tile-based blitter that writes to a frame buffer. The buffer is never cleared, so stuff drawn is left over from frame to frame until it is overwritten.

- Tiles are stored in ROM and have a fixed 16x16 size. The blitter can draw them as single sprites (composed of one or more tiles in the horizontal direction), or as larger sprites whose tile codes are picked from a tilemap in RAM.

- Sprites can be zoomed, distorted and rotated.

- shangkid/hiryuken: The BBX coprocessor is burried in an epoxy block (1.5" by 2" by 4" black). The block is connected to the PCB by a 40 pin DIP socket labeled IC30. It contains: a surface-mounted Z80 (TMPZ84C00P), LS245 logic IC and battery backed ram chip Fujitsu MB8464. The BBX coprocessor receives graphics and sound-related commands from the main CPU via shared RAM. It directly manages an AY8910, is responsible for populating spriteram, and forwards appropriate sound commands to the sample-playing CPU.

- Col $f8 is used for the man, col $fc for the red/pink "explosion" under the puck. (Use this to track where they are in spriteram quickly.) Both of these colors are only set when the first super-shot happens, so it's clear those colors are for the super-shot... but screenshot evidence proves the man should be entirely black.

NOTES:

- Slapshot uses one or two newer Taito custom ics, but the hardware is very similar to the Taito F2 system, especially F2 games using the same TC0480SCP tilemap generator (e.g. Metal Black).

- Operation Wolf 3 is on almost identical hardware to Slapshot. It uses far more graphics data and samples than Slapshot. Compared to Taito's gun game Under Fire (1993), the hardware here is obviously underpowered. Large data roms help the 68000 throw around the gfx (a method used in Dino Rex) but can't disguise that it should have been done using enhanced Z system or F3 system hardware.

- BG not using second half of prom, of interest is this half is identical to the second half of a bankp/appoooh prom, hardware is similar to bankp/appoooh in a few ways, there's also an unused SEGA logo in the bg graphics.

- FG not using odd colours, shouldn't matter as the colours are duplicated.

- Sprite priorities are wrong when bikes are jumping as they are ordered on vertical position only, assume this is original behaviour.

TODO:

- All Games: CRT controller CRT controller (resolution+visible area+flip screen?) Proper "shadows" support: the low 4 bits of the pens from a "shadowing" tile (regardless of color code) substitute the top 4 bits of the color index (0-7fff) in the frame buffer.

- hypreac2: Communication with other units tilemap sprites use the yoffset specified in the sprites-list? (see the 8 pixel gap between the backgrounds and the black rows)

- mslider: V60 issues? The correct tiles don't always vanish, depending on the layout of the 3 tiles you put together sometimes only 2 vanish and a blank are off the bottom of the game board flashes instead of the correct 3rd tile

- srmp4: Backgrounds are offset by $60 pixels, so they're kludged to work.

- srmp7: Needs interrupts by the sound chip (unsupported yet). Kludged to work.

- stmblade: There is a rogue "tilemap" sprite that pops up at level 2 and stays there till the end of the game (a piece of sky to the left of the screen). It seems that the x&y offsets in the sprite list should be apllied to it (-$200,-$200) to move it off screen. But currently those offsets are ignored for "tilemap" sprites. This may be related to the kludge for srmp4.

- ultrax: Bad gfx offsets and wrong visible area

- twineag2: Bad gfx offsets on some scenes

- dynagear: Requires 2 kludges for the video emulation and has some bad shadow sprites on the left side of the screen.

- Joryuu Syougi Kyoushitsu: Uses an unemulated NEC V810 CPU instead of the V60.


NOTES:

- Hardware: Seta, Sammy, Visco = SSV

- Mahjong Hyper Reaction: The game prints "backup ram ok" and there is code to test some ram at 0x580000-0x5bffff. The test is skipped and this ram isn't used though. I guess it's either a left-over or there are different version with some battery backed RAM (which would indeed be on the rom-board, AFAIK)


Inp:

- srmp7: Often loses sync after a few hands. I think this may be related to sound IRQ callback from the sound chip, which is currently kludged to work in MAME. This game won't run with sound disabled, it hangs on the score totalling. It would appear that using a sample rate of 11025Hz allows it to record and playback correctly. Check this inp, should play through to the second opponent, losing on that first hand there.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The range of sprite position values doesn't suffice to move the zoomed spaceship sprite over the top and left edges of the screen. These additional values are used to compensate for this. Technically, they cut off the first columns and rows of the spaceship sprite, but in practice they work like offsets in zoomed pixels.

- Some mysterious game code at address $2CCE is causing erratic images in the target explosion sequence. The following condition is a hack to filter these images.

- Starfield: The LSFR is reset once per frame at the position of sprite 15. This behavior is quite pointless and not really needed by the game. Not emulated.

NOTES:

- Hardware: Sega ST-V (Sega Titan Video) - known as a Sega Saturn for the Arcades

- Driver: SCSP driver provided by R. Belmont, based on ElSemi's SCSP sound chip emulator. CD Block driver provided by ANY,based on sthief original emulator. Many thanks to Guru, Fabien & Runik for the help given.

- Hardware overview: Two SH-2 CPUs,in a master/slave configuration.The master cpu is used to boot-up and to do the most of the work,the slave one does extra work that could be too much for a single cpu.They both shares all the existant devices, a M68000 CPU,used to drive sound(the SCSP chip).The program is uploaded via the SH-2 cpus, a SMPC (System Manager & Peripheral Control),used to drive all the devices on the board, a SCU (System Control Unit),mainly used to do DMA operations and to drive interrupts,it also has a DSP, an (optional for the ST-V) SH-1 CPU,used to be the CD driver, an A-Bus, where the cart ROM area is located, a B-Bus, where the Video Hardware & the SCU sections are located, two VDPs chips(named as 1 & 2), used for the video section: VDP2 is for the tilemap system,there are: 4 effective normal layers, 2 roz layers, 1 back layer, 1 line layer. The VDP2 is capable of the following things (in order): Dynamic resolution (up to 740x480) & various interlacing modes, mosaic process, scrolling,scaling,horizontal & vertical cell scrolling for the normal planes, the roz ones can also rotate, versatile window system,used for various effects, alpha-blending,refered as Color Calculation in the docs, shadow effects and global rgb brightness control,separate for every plane. This hardware comes above hell on the great list of hellish things as far as emulation goes anyway.


WIP:

- 0.83: Mariusz Wojcieszek added VDP2 layer disabling based on VRAM cycle pattern registers - this fixes gfx glitches in shanhigw title screen, added VDP1 half transparency - this improves sprites alpha blending in shanhigw in-game, and added VDP1 Gouraud shading (for normal sprites only) - this adds highlighting for selected tiles in shanhigw.

- 0.82u2: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed the bad RGB sprites colors and incorrect sprite clipping, added color offset for RGB sprites and fixed horizontal scrolling for bitmaps (corrects mausuke ingame background).

- 0.82u1: Angelo Salese fixed a window mode bug in STV VDP-2 and Mariusz Wojcieszek update STV VDP-1: Converted VDP1 drawing (sprites) to use framebuffer, added sprite priorities (corrects shanhigw ingame and colmns97 title screen), added color offset for sprites, improved sprites alpha blending (improves ejihon and shienryu intro), added framebuffer interlace (fixes elandore character selection screen), added color offset for bitmaps and added vertical scrolling for bitmaps (corrects shanhigw ingame). The main result (visible to user) of these changes is that shanhigw is now playable without problems (apart from gfx glitches on title screen).

- 15th April 2004: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed a sprite rendering bug in the ST-V driver where some sprites got distorted to the wrong size, improving Othello Shiyouyo title screen, helicopter in Die Hard Arcade, attract modes in Cotton Boomerang and Hanagumi Taisen Columns and it also makes Super Major League almost playable.

- 0.81u4: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixes sprites in groovef which is now playable, adds some RBG0 scrolling which greatly improves background graphics in cotton2, cottonbm, grdforce and othellos.

- 31st March 2004: Mariusz Wojcieszek sent in an update to the ST-V driver, adding support for the end code feature in VDP1 which improved sprites in Columns '97, Ejihon Tantei Jimusyo, Shienryu and fixing some bugs in the SCU DSP emulation.

- 0.80u3: Added new stv_vdp1_framebuffer HANDLER and update the ST-V ADDRESS_MAP.

- 0.80u2: Angelo Salese update the ST-V. Fixes bitmap transparencies, added the RBG0 layer(no scroll/roz effects yet), added a really preliminary window effect(just for get tile-based sprites in shanhigw) and readded the VDP1 PTM register support which has been lost in the past.

- 0.80u1: Mariusz Wojcieszek improved scaling tilemap backgrounds. Vfkids, colmns97 and vfremix backgrounds are better now. And fixed a problem where entering and existing service mode during game causes master/slave communication to fail. It turned out that slave cpu should be reset when it is turned off and on. This helps all games in driver.

- 0.80: Angelo Salese made various ST-V improvements (brightness controls).

- 28th February 2004: Angelo Salese added RGB brightness control to VDP2 in the ST-V driver and kludged Power Instinct 3 so that it boots (it has missing sprites though).

- 0.79: Olivier Galibert update the ST-V driver to use new memory system, cleaning up the map.

- 21st January 2004: Olivier Galibert merged the ST-V driver memory maps and Aaron Giles fixed a problem in it.

- 20th January 2004: R. Belmont fixed many things in the ST-V sound system and as a result many more games have working sound in that driver.

- 19th January 2004: R. Belmont - Fixed some ST-V bugs, sound now works in a lot more games (but not Die Hard or Baku Baku yet, still tracing).

- 16th January 2004: Mariusz Wojcieszek improved the ST-V driver sprite color calculation, fixing problems with Shienryu sprite colors and Winter Heat character selection screen.

- 0.78u4: Mariusz Wojcieszek added some ST-V alpha blending (see bakubaku playfield, mausuke playfield, shienryu clouds etc.).

- 0.78u1: Mariusz Wojcieszek improve the ST-V emulation: 1. Changes to sprites color calculation. I fixed it using in color bank modes by using color offset register from VDP2. Now shienryu kludge is no longer needed and also sprite colors in Winter Heat and Virtua Fighter Kids are correct. 2. Changes for Princess Clara Daisakusen (prikura) so that game is playable now (as far I tested it). 3. Prikura tried to render distorted sprites with xsize = 0 or ysize = 0 and this caused crash. As these values are prohibited according to manual, I ignore distorted sprites with xsize = 0 or ysize = 0. I found that missing MINIT for slave to run the sprites is done by using address 0x01406f40 instead of 0x01000000. I'm not sure if my change is a hack or real hardware behaves in that way, but in my opinion it is possible that whole range of addresses (0x01000000 - 0x017fffff) is used for MINIT. I added MINIT only for one address used by prikura. 4. Bad sprite colors were fixed in point 1. 5. Small change for vdp2: commented out a call to usrintf_showmessage().

- 0.77u3: Angelo Salese and Mariusz Wojcieszek made some STV improvements.

- 11th December 2003: Mariusz Wojcieszek submitted an improvement to the SCU DSP emulation in the ST-V driver, but Virtua Fighter Remix still doesn't work properly.

- 26th November 2003: R. Belmont and ElSemi fixed various bugs in the SCSP sound core, improving the sound greatly in the ST-V driver.

- 0.77u1: Minor cleanups to stv.c (specifically changed some variables to static) [Nathan Woods].

- 0.77: Angelo Salese made various ST-V improvements. Remove some unknown dipswitch entries.

- 0.76u2: Several ST-V games are probably now playable, however be warned many are very very slow, this is not a bug, sound is still poor or non-existant in most titles, these haven't been tested for long so could easily fail at later levels. Games which were marked as working in previous updates are also improved (shienryu etc.) [David Haywood, Angelo Salese, Olivier Galibert].

- 29th October 2003: Olivier Galibert added distorted sprite drawing to the ST-V driver, adding 3D graphics in a lot of games. David Haywood added sprite zoom to the ST-V driver, and a few more games show some graphics now: Cotton 2, Cotton Boomerang, Columns 97, Die Hard, Ejihon Tantei Jimusyo, Virtua Fighter Kids, Virtua Fighter Remix, Funky Head Boxers, Othello Shiyouyo, Pro Mahjong Kiwame S, Winter Heat and Taisen Tanto-R Sashissu!!

- 28th October 2003: David Haywood fixed the controls in the ST-V driver, making Mausuke no Ojama the World and Puyo Puyo Sun fully playable, but Puyo Puyo Sun is extremely slow.

- 27th October 2003: R. Belmont fixed the ST-V crash that happened with -nosound.

- 0.76u1: Added YMF292-F_SCSP stereo sound. David Haywood made more ST-V Improvements, fixing various graphical issues (Shienryu Sprite Colours) and general other bits and pieces. More games are 'watchable' now, for example Cotton 2, Cotton Boomerang, Puyo Puyo Sun, Columns 97 however they lack controls. R. Belmont ported ElSemi's SCSP core, this gives preliminary sound in the ST-V games, however at the moment most of them play static, Shienryu is mostly correct.

- 25th October 2003: R. Belmont added ElSemi's SCSP sound chip emulator to the ST-V driver, but the sound and music only works properly in Shienryu.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The SunA 16 Bit games have only sprites, of a peculiar type. There is a region of memory where 32 pages of 32x32 tile codes can be written like a tilemap made of 32 pages of 256x256 pixels. Each tile uses 2 words. Sprites are rectangular regions of *tiles* fetched from there and sent to the screen. Each sprite uses 4 words, held where the last page of tiles would be.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The SunA 8 Bit games have only sprites, of a peculiar type. There is a region of memory where 4 pages of 32x32 tile codes can be written like a tilemap made of 4 pages of 256x256 pixels. Each tile uses 2 bytes. Later games may use more pages through RAM banking. Sprites are rectangular regions of *tiles* fetched from there and sent to the screen. Each sprite uses 4 bytes, held within the last page of tiles.

- 15th December 2002: Kale fixed the record/playback function in the Super Kaneko Nova System driver.

- 20th October 2002: Olivier Galibert fixed a few things in the SH-2 CPU core and added DMA support which improves Sengeki Striker in the Super Kaneko Nova System driver, although there are still several graphics problems.

- 27th September 2002: David Haywood fixed the background graphics in Jan Jan Paradise 2 with a redumped ROM and he fixed another problem that also caused incorrect graphics emulation in it.

- 17th September 2002: Paul Priest added sprite zooming and background linescroll and fixed sprite positions in the Super Kaneko Nova System driver.

- 15th September 2002: R. Belmont fixed the SH7604 internal timers so that the music in the Super Kaneko Nova System games is fixed and the controls work in the Taisen Hot Gimmick games.

- 14th September 2002: R. Belmont implemented the SH7604 internal timers which gets music and sound running in the rest of the Super Kaneko Nova System games, but the music still suddenly stops working after a while in the games. It also added sound to Sol Divide and gets the Taisen Hot Gimmick games working. Uki added the controls to both Taisen Hot Gimmick and Taisen Hot Gimmick Kairakuten, but the controls stop working after a while, like the music in the Super Kaneko Nova System games. Nicola Salmoria optimized the Super Kaneko Nova System tilemap graphics drawing even more, and Paul Priest added support for separate RGB brightness controls, fixing the color fades in the games.

- 13th September 2002: Nicola Salmoria reduced the memory requirements of the Super Kaneko Nova System driver and hooked up the rotation and zoom control registers. David Haywood and Paul Priest optimized the graphics drawing in it a little.

- 12th September 2002: David Haywood sent in an update to the Super Kaneko Nova System driver, fixing the sprite positioning in Gals Panic 4 and Gals Panic S.

- 11th September 2002: Nicola Salmoria added sound emulation to some of the games in the Super Kaneko Nova System driver, Paul Priest fixed the inputs, added Puzz Loop European version and cleaned up a few things in it and David Haywood added Panic Street, Gal's Panic S2 and Jan Jan Paradise 2 which are playable, and Gal's Panic S and Gal's Panic 4 which have some misplaced sprites. Jan Jan Paradise 2 has a bad graphics ROM which causes some graphics to be corrupt.

- 10th September 2002: David Haywood updated and re-wrote S. Glaize's old Super Kaneko Nova System driver. The driver lacks sound and has graphics glitches, but Cyvern, Puzz Loop, Sen-know, Otome Ryouran, Tel Jan and Jan Jan Paradise are playable.

- 21st February 2002: S. Glaize reported progress on Super Kaneko Nova System which uses the Hitachi SH-2 CPU. Gal's Panic S and Gal's Panic 4 work up to the title screen, Panic Street, Cyvern, Jan Jan Paradise, Sen-know and Tel Jan work up to the actual gameplay but crash after a while, and Puzz Loop isn't playable although the attract mode shows something.

TODO:

- altbeast writes to mirrored sprite RAM at $441000

- tturfu has bad single sprite frame when main character walks

- dduxbl has some 'stuck' sprites


NOTES:

- toryumon RAM test accesses mirrored work RAM. Maybe there's a better way to support this than using AM_MASK.

- I separated the fpoint and fpointbl,fpointbj machine drivers as the latter two have different sound hardware, but the original does not. I think this creates a dependancy where fpointbl.zip needs flpoint.001 from fpointbj.zip, as fpointbl uses fpoint ROMs (it's parent), it's own, and the sound ROM from fpointbj. So add fpoint.001 to fpointbl.zip for it to work. I made fpointbl the parent of fpointbj so it would use the proper memory map for the sound hardware.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Better abstraction of tilemap hardware is needed; a lot of this mess could and should be consolidated further

- Many games have ROM patches - why?  let's emulate protection when possible

- Several games fail their RAM self-test because of hacks in the drivers

- Many registers are suspiciously plucked from working RAM

- Several games have nvram according to the self test, but we aren't yet saving it

- Many games suffer from sys16_refreshenable register not being mapped

- Road-rendering routines need to be cleaned up or at least better described

- Logical sprite height computation isn't quite right - garbage pixels are drawn

- Screen orientation support for sprite drawing

- Sprite drawing is unoptimized

- End-of-sprite marker support will fix some glitches

- Shadow and partial shadow sprite support

- To achieve sprite-tilemap orthogonality we must draw sprites from front to back; this will also allow us to avoid processing the same shadowed pixel twice.

- None of the games that feature a cocktail or a flip screen dip (aurail, eswat, fantzone, mjleague, shinobi, timscanr) support it properly.system16c36finalgreFrotz

- moonwlkb VDP test says IC68 (315-5313) is bad, but the test code seems to print the 'bad' message always, and it doesn't look like that VDP layer is supposed to cover the text (indicating success).

- astormbl writes to mirrored sprite RAM at $141000.

- moonwlkb writes to mirrored palette RAM at $841000.

- shdancbl: Sampled sound needs to be implemented. ROM test fails. Maybe the original game code was not patched to fix this, rather than the ROMs really being bad. Supporting the screen blanking control at $E4001D causes some problems after coin-up. Player 1 inputs map to player 2. Misplaced tilemap horizontal scrolling in several locations: Level map screen, bonus stage, train level, sewer level, etc. Bad sprites in some specific cases: Green shield-throwing man, animation when dog attacks enemy, fade-in when ninjas appear, etc. Missing "Shadow Dancer" logo on title screen if you insert a coin instead of watching the intro sequence. I very carefully checked the sprite ROMs to make sure they are loaded correctly, and it seems that for the bad sprites listed above, one of the even/odd pair is correct while the other is not. The correct data isn't present in any of the ROMs I think. Maybe they need to be redumped, or it's an actual problem of the bootleg?


NOTES:

- The sys18_sound_info structure holds the offset to each ROM in the REGION_CPU2 space as well as a mask to be applied to the 8K bank offset into each ROM. For an unused ROM, the mask should be set to zero.

- Driver based on the "Modeler" emulator by Farfetch'd, R. Belmont, and Olivier Galibert.

- Hardware: Sega System 32 => V60 + 4 zooming, source linescrolled, alpha blended tilemap planes + zooming sprites + 1 front tilemap w/ram-based characters + ram-based zooming alpha-blended sprites + global r/g/b brightness controls. Z80 + 2xYM3438 + RF5c68 for sound (similar to System 18 with a larger ROM capacity). The later System Multi32 (two monitors and two sets of controls from one PCB with one main CPU) has mostly the same hardware, with these changes: V70 replaces the V60 (faster but 100% software compatible) 2 of the tilemaps are hardwired to the left monitor, 2 to the right. The sprite attribute layout changes, and a bit indicates if each sprite should draw on the left or right monitor. One YM3438 is removed, and the RF5c68 is replaced by the far more powerful Sega "MultiPCM" IC.

TODO:

- Fix hi-score (reset) bug

- What is prom fjo.25 for?


NOTES:

- Hardware is very similar to the BurgerTime/Lock N Chase family of games but there are just enough differences to make it a pain to share the codebase. It looks like this hardware is a bridge between the BurgerTime family and the later Technos games, like Mat Mania and Mysterious Stones. The video hardware supports 3 sprite banks instead of 1. The sound hardware appears nearly identical to Mat Mania.

TODO:

- hitice: ice trails might not be 100% correct (I'm doubling them horizontally)

- hitice: the pixel bitmap is not cleared on startup nor during attract mode. There's a kludge to fix it in the first case.

- rambo3a: has a lot of unmapped writes in the VCU area (log up to end of round 2) [viofight also does a few]

- The eprom games could have a single io handler if it's confirmed all 3 use a special 4 player I/O chip. Puzzle Bobble and qzshowby use TC0640FIO

- Can the text layer scroll? (hitice: glass walls at beginning of match, also check when the screen wiggles after the puck hits the wall shortly into the first round of attract mode)

- Sprites are not in perfect sync with the background. Check ashura, they are almost tight during gameplay but completely off in attract mode.


NOTES:

- Driver by Jarek Burczynski, with help from: Nicola Salmoria, Brian A. Troha, Stephane Humbert, Gerardo Oporto Jorrin, David Graves heavily based on Taito F2 System driver by Brad Oliver, Andrew Prime

- Hardware: The Taito B system is a fairly flexible hardware platform. It supports 4 separate layers of graphics - one 64x64 tiled scrolling background plane of 16x16 tiles, a similar foreground plane, a sprite plane capable of sprite zooming and 'pageable' text plane of 8x8 tiles. Sound is handled by a Z80 with a YM2610 or YM2610B or YM2203's connected to it. Different sound chips - depending on game. The memory map for each of the games is similar but not identical.

- Master of Weapon has a secret command to select level: (sequence is the same as in Metal Black): - boot machine with service switch pressed - message appears: "SERVICE SWITCH ERROR" - press 1p start, 1p start, 1p start, service switch, 1p start - message appears: "SELECT BY DOWN SW" - select level with joy down/up - press 1p start button. Other games that have this feature: Rastan Saga 2, Crime City, Violence Fight and Rambo 3.

TODO:

- The sprite system is still partly a mystery, and not an accurate emulation. A lot of sprite glitches are caused by data in sprite ram not being correct, part from one frame and part from the previous one. There has to be some buffering inside the chip but it's not clear how. See below the irq section for a long list of observations on sprite glitches. Other limitations include: misplaced tile of the zooming title in Qcrayon (the one on the yellow background in attract); sprites when you get a home run in Koshien are often out on x axis by 1 pixel.

- TC0480SCP emulation (footchmp, metalb, deadconx) has slight inaccuracies. Zoomed layers and zoomed pixel rows are not precisely positioned.

- DIPS, still many unknown

- Restored save states on some games tend to hang.

- All non-quiz games except Solfigtr have 2 country sets dumped: if 1 byte diff then create the third set.

- Don Doko Don: Roz layer is one pixel out vertically when screen flipped.

- Cameltry (camltrua): Alt version with YM2203 sound missing ADPCM chip? Also sound tempo may be fractionally too slow.

- Gun Frontier: There are mask sprites used on the waterfall in the first round of attract demo, however it's not clear what they should mask since there don't seem to be sprites below them. Shadow maybe?

- Pulirula: In level 3, the mask sprites used for the door are misaligned by one pixel to the left.

- Metal Black: Tilemap screenflip support has an issue: blue planet early in attract should be 1 pixel left. Sprite emulation issues may be responsible for minor glitches on the "bolts" on round 4 boss ship: some sprite/tilemap lag creeps in. Missing two blend effects: there's a sun sprite underneath tilemaps in round 1; and the boss sprite crosses under the tilemaps at start of round 5 finale.

- Yesnoj: Input mapping incomplete. There's a 0x01 one which only seems to be used in printer [printer test?] mode. It seems to be a printer status input. With the value currently returned, it sounds an alarm and says [Japanese trans.] "Error detected on the printer. Call machine operator." The timer stays at 00:00. Missing RTC emulation? [Coin lockout/ctr?]

- Quiz Crayon 2: There should be a highlight circle around the player while it moves on the map. This is done by a sprite which doesn't have priority over the background. This is probably the same thing as the waterfall in Gun Frontier.

- Driftout: Sprites are 1 pixel too far right in screenflip. Roz layer is around 4 pixels too far down in screenflip.

- Driveout: Sound


NOTES:

- Metal Black has secret command to select stage. Start the machine with holding service switch. Then push 1p start, 1p start, 1p start, service SW, 1p start while error message is displayed. (This also works in many of the other games. Use in Don Doko Don to play an extra set of fifty levels.)

TODO:

- Sound eats lots of memory as 8 bit PCM data is decoded as 16 bit for use by the current ES5505 core (which rightly should be 16 bit).

- Zoomed layers are not always positioned quite correctly in flipscreen mode (Grid Seeker).

- Dsp isn't hooked up.

- Crowd/boards not shown in the football games.

- Sound doesn't work in RidingF/RingRage/QTheater?


NOTES:

- Driver by Bryan McPhail. Ian Schmidt and Stileto for sound information! Aaron Giles for sound info, figuring out the 68K/ES5505 rom interface and ES5505 emulator.


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The Taito F3 system has 4 scrolling layers, 1 scrolling text layer, 1 scrolling pixel layer and 2 sprite banks. Also Sprite scaling, Rowscroll on all playfields, Line by line zoom on all playfields, Column scroll on all playfields and Line by line sprite and playfield priority mixing.

- Not yet supported is Alpha blending on playfields and VRAM layer.


Bugs:

- All games: Read the text file for info about the types of cabinets and their related inputs. taito_f3_cab057ora stephh

- puchicar, elvactr, others: Don't know why, but in these two games the sound gives sfxs not in line on what you're doing in game. Example: when you finish a combo in Puchicar there is the @GO!@ sample or some pistol shoots in elvactr while you are jumping(!). Ah, doesn't happen always in the two examples I've made. Corrupting bug?. Note: this bug also affects pbobble3, pbobble4, and happens in akkanvdr in later levels. Update: In various games (for example elvactr and kaiserkn, there's a lot of garbagey noises that play randomly throughout the game. Update (MAME .63) : This bug is mostly fixed now, but random instruments still play in pbobble3 in round 3 or 4. Also in those stages and in stage 3 of gekirido, there is still a trace occasionally of the squirelly high-pitched garbage noise that used to be heavy in elvactr and others in in .62. Update (MAME .71u2) : In elvactr and clones, the stereo volume isn't balanced correctly, sound coming out of the left speaker is almost always much lower than the right. taitof3c053gre Kale / Jonemaan / Iron Man / Smitdogg / NeoGouki / Christopher Tripodi

- kaiserkn, kaiserkj, gblchmp, dankuga: When thrown by Azteca's medium punch throw (I think that was the one) the palette of the thrown character gets all messed up. It stays that way the entire round, unless you're hit by Azteca's F, DF, D, DB, B + Punch up close for instance.. (see snapshots). kaiserkn062gre NeoGouki


Possible Bugs:

- Various: Some games appear with a flattened display, eg. arkretrn, pbobble, pbobble2, pbobble3, pbobble4. It does not occur in spcnv95u and possibly others. It does not occur with hwstretch enabled. -nokeepaspect fixes it as does -noswitchres with my desktop at 1024x768. taito_f3c061gre asmodius


Port:

- The coin mechs uses a trick to prevent illegal coins. This may be "fixed" by using PORT_BIT_IMPULSE at 10 frames per press for the coin bits.

TODO:

- champwr ADPCM interface is not entirely understood, it involves also addresses 0xd000 and 0xe000, and maybe also YM2203 port B.

- slowdowns in fhawk, probably the interrupts have to be generated at a different time.

- plgirls doesn't work without a kludge because of an interrupt issue. This happens because the program enables interrupts before setting IM2, so the interrupt vector is interpreted as IM0, which is obviously bogus.

- The puzznic protection is worked around, but I'm not happy with it (the 68705-returned values are wrong, I'm sure of that).

- A bunch of control registers are simply ignored

- The source of irqs 0 and 1 is unknown, while 2 is vblank (0 is usually ignored by the program, 1 leads to reading the ports... maybe vbl-in, vbl-out and hblank ?).

- Text Plane colors are only right in Cuby Bop once you've started a game & reset

- Scrolling in Cuby Bop's Game seems incorrect.


NOTES:

- The system uses RAM based characters, which aren't really supported by the TileMap system, so we have to tilemap_mark_all_tiles_dirty() to compensate

- kurikina has some debug dip switches (invulnerability, slow motion) so might be a prototype. It also doesn't have service mode (or has it disabled).

TODO:

- Fix known problems.

- Any other games that worked on this board?

- What is correct date for Ballbros? Two different ones appear in this driver!

- Gigandes: Gigandes has background tile glitches on the demo of cave stage (the last one before it does demo of level 1 again). It seems to be rapidly switching between two different background layers. This may be because the game has put different tiles in bank 0 and bank 1 (which alternate each frame). The other strangeness is that the background is not scrolling. So chances are the graphics chip emulation is flawed. When this cuts to hiscore screen there is flickering white tilemap garbage beneath. These leftover tiles have not been cleared from $e00800-bff (but they have been from $e02800). So alternate 2 frames display the bank with garbage tiles and the one without. Probably some control register should be keeping the graphics chip in the cleared bank, so the garbage is never visible. Separate bank control for sprite / tile layers ? Maybe this effect is also desired during the cave stage.


NOTES:

- Details of custom chip numbers on Superman would be welcome.

- Superman seems to be the only game of the four with a c-chip. Daisenpu appears to use a simple input device with coin counter and lockout in its place. The East Technology games on this hardware follow Daisenpu.

Speculative YM2610 a/b/c channel filtering as these may be outputs to subwoofer (vibration). They sound better, anyway.

- Battle Shark: Is road on the road stages correct? Hard to tell. Does the original have the "seeking" crosshair effect, making it a challenge to control?

- SCI: Road seems ok, but are the green bushes in round 1 a little too far to the edge of the interroad verge? Sprite frames were plotted in opposite order so flickered. Reversing this has lost us alternate frames: probably need to buffer sprite ram by one frame to solve this?

- Night Striker: Road A/B priority problems will manifest in the choice tunnels with, one or the other having higher priority in top and bottom halves. Can someone provide a sequence of screenshots showing exactly what happens at the road split point. Strange page in test mode which lets you alter all sorts of settings, may relate to sit-in cockpit version. Can't find a dip that disables this. Does a variety of writes to TC0220IOC offset 3... significant?

- Aqua Jack: Sprites left on screen under hiscore table. Deliberate? Or is therea sprite disable bit somewhere. Should road body be largely transparent as I've implemented it? Sprite/sprite priorities often look bad. Sprites go to max size for a frame before they explode - surely a bug. Hangs briefly fairly often without massive cpu interleaving (500). Keys aren't very responsive in test mode.

- Spacegun: Problem with the zoomed sprites not matching up very well when forming the background. They jerk a bit relative to each other... probably a cpu sync thing, perhaps also some fine-tuning required on the zoomed sprite dimension calcs. Light gun interrupt timing arbitrary.

- Double Axle: Road occasionally has incorrectly unclipped line appearing at top (ice stage). Also road 'ghost' often remains on screen - also an interrupt issue I presume. Double Axle has poor sound: one ADPCM rom should be twice as long? (see log file).


NOTES:

- Driver based on the MAME F2 driver and Raine source.

- The Taito Z system has a number of similarities with the Taito F2 system, and uses some of the same custom Taito components.

- TaitoZ supports 5 separate layers of graphics - one 64x64 tiled scrolling background plane of 8x8 tiles, a similar foreground plane, another optional plane used for drawing a road (e.g. Chasehq), a sprite plane [with varying properties], and a text plane with character definitions held in ram.

- Double Axle has four rather than two background planes, and they contain 32x32 16x16 tiles. This is because it uses a TC0480SCP rather than the older TC0100SCN tilemap generator used in previous Taito Z games. The hardware for Taito's Super Chase was a further development of this, with a 68020 for main CPU and Ensoniq sound - standard features of Taito's F3 system. Taito's F3 system superceded both Taito B and F2 systems, but the Taito Z system was enhanced with F3 features and continued in games like Super Chase and Under Fire up to the mid 1990s.

- The Z system has twin 68K CPUs which communicate via shared ram.

TODO:

- Video section hung off TaitoH driver, it should be separate.

- 3d graphics h/w: do the gradiation ram and line ram map to hardware which creates the 3d background scenes? It seems the TMS320C25 is being used as a co-processor to relieve the 68000 of 3d calculations... it has direct access to line ram along with the 68000. Seems gradiation ram is responsibility of 68000. Unless - unlikely IMO - there is banking allowing the 32025 to select this area in its address map.

- "Power common ram" is presumably for communication with an MCU controlling the sit-in-cabinet (deluxe mechanized version only).

- Offer dip-selectable kludge of the analogue stick inputs so that keyboard play is possible?

- Unknown control bits remain in the 0x140000 write.

- DIPs

- Topland: Sprite/tile priority bad. After demo game in attract, palette seems too dark for a while. Palette corruption has occured with areas not restored after a fade. Don't know why. (Perhaps 68000 relies on feedback from co-processor in determining what parts of palette ram to write... but this would then be fixed by hookup of 32025 core, which it isn't.) Mechanized cabinet has a problem with test mode: there is code at $d72 calling a sub which tests a silly amount of "power common ram"; $80000 words (only one byte per word used). Probably the address map wraps, and only $400 separate words are actually accessed ? TMS320C25 emulation: one unmapped read which appears to be discarded. But the cpu waits for a bit to be zero... some sort of frame flag or some "ready" message from the 3d h/w perhaps? The two writes seem to take only two values.

- AirInferno: Sprite/tile priority bad.

You can start at any level from 1..81, so it's an easy way of seeing what the game can throw at you.

NOTES:

- Video Controller Hack: Sigh. CPU #1 reads the video controller register twice per frame, once at the beginning of interrupt and once near the end. It stores these values in a table starting at $163484. CPU #2 periodically looks at this table to make sure that it is getting interrupts at the appropriate times, and that the VBLANK bit is set appropriately. Unfortunately, due to all the cpu_yield() calls we make to synchronize the two CPUs, we occasionally get out of time and generate the interrupt outside of the tight tolerances CPU #2 expects. So we fake it. Returning scanlines $f5 and $f7 alternately provides the correct answer that causes CPU #2 to be happy and not aggressively trash memory (which is what it does if this interrupt test fails -- see the code at $1E56 to see!).

Uncertain Bugs:

- Detana!! Twin Bee's remaining sprite lag does not appear to be emulation related. While these common one-pixel lags are very obvious on VGA-class displays they're virtually invisible on TV and older 15kHz arcade monitors.

- TMNT2: "BIG APPLE, 3 AM" is not played in the first loop. I believe it's a design decision because it'll cut into the last intro dialogue. The game looks up sound codes of these prologue lines from two different tables. One for the first loop and the other for any loop thereafter. The SNES port plays it everytime probably because it has no intro speech. If the real board turns out otherwise I have no idea how to fix it except patching the first table.

- TMNT: In the sewer level when purple foot soldiers jump out of the water they turn white for a short moment. The color index is copied straight form ROM and nothing unusual is found in that part the code. There is no known protection in this game so this bug may need reconfirmation.


NOTES:

- Driver contains several Konami 68000 based games. For the most part they run on incompatible boards, but since 90% of the work is done by the custom ICs emulated in vidhrdw/konamiic.c, we can just as well keep them all together.

TEST MODE:

- extrmatn and arknoid2 have a special test mode. The correct procedure to make it succeed is as follows: enter service mode, on the color test screen, press 2 (player 2 start), set dip switch 1 and dip switch 2 so that they read 00000001, reset the emulation, and skip the previous step. press 5 (coin 1). Text at the bottom will change to "CHECKING NOW". use all the inputs, including tilt, until all inputs are OK, press 5 (coin 1) - to confirm that coin lockout 1 works, press 5 (coin 1) - to confirm that coin lockout 2 works, set dip switch 1 to 00000000, set dip switch 1 to 10101010, set dip switch 1 to 11111111, set dip switch 2 to 00000000, set dip switch 2 to 10101010, set dip switch 2 to 11111111, speaker should now output a tone, press 5 (coin 1) , to confirm that OPN works, press 5 (coin 1) , to confirm that SSGCH1 works, press 5 (coin 1) , to confirm that SSGCH2 works, press 5 (coin 1) , to confirm that SSGCH3 works and finished ("CHECK ALL OK!").


VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- New Zealand Story doesn't have a color PROM. It uses 1024 bytes of RAM to dynamically create the palette. Each couple of bytes defines one color (15 bits per pixel; the top bit of the second byte is unused). Since the graphics use 4 bitplanes, hence 16 colors, this makes for 32 different color codes.

- Arkanoid has a two 512x8 palette PROMs. The two bytes joined together form 512 xRRRRRGGGGGBBBBB color values.

TODO:

- Add support for HD647180 (Z180) sound CPUs (once their internal ROMS are dumped). These are: Fire Shark/Same! Same! Same! Vimana


NOTES:

- Driver by Darren Olafson. Technical info: Carl-Henrik Skarstedt & Magnus Danielsson. Driver updates: Quench. Video updates: SUZ

- Fire Shark and Same! Same! Same! have a hidden function for the service input. When invulnerability is enabled, pressing the service input makes the screen scroll faster.

- OutZone (set 2) has a bug in the 68K code. An Jump instruction at $3E6 goes to to an invalid instruction at $13DA4. It should really jump to $13DAA. This bad jump is executed by flicking the 'Service DSW' while after the game has booted. The other Outzone set correctly goes to service mode, but this set just loses the plot.

- OutZone sprite priorities are unusual. On level 4, a character with low priority (6) is hidden by a higher priority (8) character, yet it shouldn't be. The character is a shooting enemy hidden by a sliding left to right platform (which he should be standing on). So how does the real hardware deal with this ?

- OutZone (set 2) uses different enemies in some stages and has extra bonuses compared to set 1. The music sequences are also in different orders between the sets. So which is the newest version ?

- Demonwld (Toaplan copyright) is a newer version, and has a different game level sequence compared to the Taito licensed version.

- Whoppee is currently using the sound CPU ROM (Z80) from a differnt (pirate ?) version of Pipi and Bibis (Ryouta Kikaku copyright). It really has a HD647180 CPU, and its internal ROM needs to be dumped.

- Fix top character text layer (implement the line position table).


NOTES:

- Raizing games and Truxton 2 are heavily dependent on the Raine source. Many thanks to Richard Bush and the Raine team.

- See Input Port definition header below, for instructions on how to enter pause/slow motion modes.

- Code at $20A26 forces territory to Japan in V-Five. Some stuff NOP'd at reset vector, and Z?80 CPU post test is skipped (bootleg ?)

- sstriker: Might be a bootleg / hack, the region jumper is read with this set but even when set to Japan you get all english text etc which seems a little odd, but might be correct.

- kingdmgp: Might be a bootleg / hack, some of the tiles needed for the credits screen have been stripped out, doesn't seem very professional, since its rare and should probably only have a different graphics rom its nearly impossible for us to verify, a lot of boards being sold as 'Kingdom Grand Prix' are infact conversions using Neill Corlett's ghastly hack. The above two look like genuine korean release boards, raizing were probably just missed a few things.



VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- Hack is needed to reset sound CPU and sound chip when machine is 'tilted' in Pipi & Bibis. Otherwise sound CPU interferes with the main CPU test of shared RAM. You get a 'Sub CPU RAM Error'.

- What do Scroll registers 0Eh and 0Fh really do ????

- Snow Bros 2 sets bit 6 of the sprite X info word during weather world map, and bits 4, 5 and 6 of the sprite X info word during the Rabbit boss screen - reasons are unknown.

- Fourth set of scroll registers have been used for Sprite scroll though it may not be correct. For most parts this looks right except for Snow Bros 2 when in the rabbit boss screen (all sprites jump when big green nasty (which is the foreground layer) comes in from the left)

- Teki Paki tests video RAM from address 0 past SpriteRAM to $37ff. This seems to be a bug in Teki Paki's vram test routine !

TODO:

- Does the bootleg use a 68000 @ 10MHz ? This causes some bad slowdowns at the floating monkey machine (round 1), so set to 12 MHz for now. Even at 12 this slowdown still happens a little.


NOTES:

- Coin inputs are handled by the sound CPU, so they don't work with sound disabled. Use the service switch instead.


Bugs:

- All games: The sound when killing an ape that comes out of the ground is wrong. In all sets. Also the sound when you jump on a device with a 10-ton weight on the other side is missing. Update: When Toki dies there is a missing sound also. Update: Verified on a real PCB: The voice samples that are played correctly seem to be played slightly too fast. Also, the volume on the MSM6295 should be increased to at least 80-85% (the real thing is pretty loud). Don't know if anyone noticed this but the sound for killing the long armed green goblin (various levels)/fire bird(Level 3)/White devil guy with pitchfork (Levels 2 and 3) is actually swapped around with the 10-ton weight sound and vice versa. When you jump on the weight, you can hear something. Turn up the sound a bit. Sort of a slimy sound. tokic060gre Styxken / Maccy / Nick / BMF54123 / AS

- Replacing the battery backed ram with an eeprom is not really an option since the game stores the current credits count in the battery backed ram.

NOTES:

- Mission 660 extensions by Paul Swan: The game appears to use the same video board as Samurai et al. There is a character column scroll feature that I have added. Its used to scroll in the "660" logo on the title screen at the beginning. Not sure if Samurai at al use it but it's likely their boards have the feature. Extra banking of the forground is done using an extra register. A bit in the background video RAM selects the additional background character space. The sound board is similar. There are 3 CPU's instead of the 2 of Samurai. 2 are still used for sample-like playback (as Samurai) and the other is used to drive the AY-3-8910 (that was driven directly by the video CPU on Samurai). The memory maps are different over Samurai, probably to allow larger capacity ROMS though only the AY driver uses 27256 on Mission 660. A picture of the board I have suggests that the AY CPU could have a DAC as well but the circuit is not populated on Mission 660. There is some kind of protection. There is code in there to do the same "unknown" reads and writes as Samurai and the original M660 won't run with the Samurai value. The bootleg M660 has the protection code patched out to use a fixed value. I've used this same value on the original M660 and it seems to work. I'm guessing the bootleg is of a "world" release and the original is from the "America" release.

TODO:

- Coin Input seems unresponsive.

- Colors: Hues are hardcoded. There doesn't appear to be any logical way to map the color proms so that the correct colors appear. See last page of schematics for details. Are color proms bad?

- Alphanumeric Layer: Placement for some characters seems strange (but may well be correct).

- Shell Objects: vstretch/placement/color handling isn't confirmed. Two bitplanes per character or two banks?

- Motion Object: Enemy ships look funny when they get close (to ram player). Stretch probably isn't implemented correctly (see splash screen with zooming "TUNNEL HUNT" logo. Colors may not be mapped correctly.

- Square Generator: Needs optimization.

VIDEO HARDWARE NOTES:

- The cool thing about this hardware is the use of microcode, which is like having a little graphics coprocessor around to do the hard stuff. The operations that can be performed by this bit of circuitry include pixel plotting, line drawing, sprite drawing, and data transfer, all with optional collision detection. In addition, data can be uploaded into the $2000-$21FF address range and then "executed" as mini subroutines. Commands to the microcode are written to the command register at $C102, followed by whatever parameters are needed. Parameters are stored in registers. The microcode is actually a big state machine, driven by the 4 PROMs at 19B,19C,19D and 19E.

NOTES:

- The plunger of the ball shooter has a black piece of plastic (flag) attached to it. When the plunger flag passes between the first section of the optical coupler, the MPU receives a non-maskable interrupt. When the flag passes between the second section of the optical coupler, the MPU calculates the time between the PLUNGER1 and PLUNGER2 signals received. This results in the MPU displaying the ball being shot onto the playfield at a certain speed.

- tkoboxng: Strobe-like flicker on title screen and some other screens before the actual match. Also crowd is plain wrong during match (sections of crowd appear to be stuck to the ring and slide with the camera)

- duckhunt: On the Clay Pigeon stage (and only on this stage), when the dog appears to laugh at you when you miss, he is drawn in front of the status bar on his way to and from the bottom of the play area instead of behind it like he should be.

- excitebk and excitbkj: These have what could be described as inverted colors on track 5 and track 7 (see snapshot). Also, the only difference in color from one version to the other is on track 3. Lastly, the bug with the Nintendo sign still occurs, but only with the Japanese set during attract mode. With both sets, it also very briefly occurs after crossing the finish line, instead of ocurring throughout the whole track as before. Here is the bug as it appears in excitbkj during attract mode. It appears that it is entirely fixed with the Playchoice version. I noticed that excitbkj is different than excitebk in that excitbkj does not have instructions during attract mode as excitebk does. This difference might be helpfull in understanding why the bug occurs.

TODO:

- I arbitrarily assigned a uniform blue overlay to sos. I don't know how it's supposed to be. navarone and kaitei are missing the overlay too.


NOTES:

- Hardware: Namco early 8080-based games. All these games run on the same hardware design, with minor differences. Gee Bee was the very first videogame released by Namco, and runs on a b&w board. The year after, the design was upgraded to add color and a second sound channel; however, the b&w board was not abandoned, and more games were written for it with the only difference of a larger gfx ROM (losing the ability to choose full or half brightness for each character).

- In the pinball games, there isn't a player 2 "serve" button - both players use the same input. I think this is correct behaviour, because there is nothing in the schematics suggesting otherwise (while there is a provision to switch from one paddle to the other). The Bomb Bee flyer shows that the cocktail cabinet did have one serve button per player, but I guess they were just wired together on the same input.

- The ball size changes from game to game. I have determined what I believe are the correct sizes by checking how the games handle the ball position in cocktail mode (the ball isn't automatically flipped by the hardware).

- kaitei and kaiteik are intriguing. The game is more or less the same, but the code is radically different, and the gfx ROMs are arranged differently. kaitei is by Namco and kaiteik is by "K'K-TOKKI". kaitei does a ROM/RAM test on startup, while kaiteik jumps straight into the game. kaitei is locked in cocktail mode, while kaiteik has support for a cabinet dip switch. The title screen in kaitei is nice and polished, while in kaiteik it's confused, with fishes going over the text. There are several other differences. The code in kaiteik is longer (0x1800 bytes vs. just 0x1000 in kaitei) and less efficient, while kaitei has some clever space optimizations. My opinion is that kaiteik is the prototype version, developed by a third party and sold to Namco, where it was rewritten.

- The coin counter doesn't work in kaiteik. This might be the expected behaviour.

- The only difference between 'warpwarr' and 'warpwar2' is the copyright string on the first screen (when the scores are displayed) : * 'warpwarr' : "(c) 1981 ROCK-OLA MFG.CORP."

(text stored at 0x33ff to 0x3415) Note that the checksum at 0x37ff (used for checking ROM at 0x3000 to 0x37ff) is different of course.

- warpwarr doesn't have an explicit Namco copyright notice, but in the default high score table the names are NNN AAA MMM CCC OOO. warpwarp doesn't have an high score table at all.


WIP:

- 0.78u4: Nicola Salmoria included a revised warpwarp.c, converted to tilemaps and with the Warp Warp Easter egg documented.

- 0.78u1: Nicola Salmoria merged geebee.c and warpwarp.c since they are variations of the same hardware design. drivers/geebee.c, machine/geebee.c and vidhrdw/geebee.c are no longer needed. Also renamed Navalone -> Navarone. I guess that's the correct name, as in "the guns of Navarone", renamed kaitein -> kaitei and kaitei -> kaiteik; made the Namco set the main one. I don't recall if this was already discussed, but I believe kaiteik is a prototype developed by a third party and sold to Namco, where it was completely rewritten. Fixed inputs and dip switches in all games, fixed "ball" size in sos and kaitein - the harpoon in kaitein no longer looks like a rock and removed a hack in Warp Warp that didn't draw the ball in the bottom left corner. The flyer confirms that the ball is supposed to be there.

TODO:

- Unknown sprite bits.

- Darius 2: The unpleasant sounds when some big enemies appear are wrong: they are meant to create rumbling on a subwoofer in the cabinet, a sort of vibration device. They still affect the other channels despite filtering above 20Hz.

- Warriorb: Colscroll effects?


NOTES:

- Driver based on the F2 driver and Raine source.

- The dual screen games operate on hardware with various similarities to the Taito F2 system, as they share some custom ics e.g. the TC0100SCN.

- For each screen the games have 3 separate layers of graphics: one 128x64 tiled scrolling background plane of 8x8 tiles, a similar foreground plane, and a 128x32 text plane with character definitions held in ram. As well as this, there is a single sprite plane which covers both screens. The sprites are 16x16 and are not zoomable.

- Warrior Blade has a slightly different gfx set for the 2nd screen because the programmers ran out of scr gfx space (only 0xffff tiles can be addressed by the TC0100SCN). In-game while tiles are scrolling from one screen to the other it is necessary to have identical gfx tiles for both screens. But for static screens (e.g. cut scenes between levels) the gfx tiles needn't be the same. By exploiting this they squeezed some extra graphics into the game.

- There is a single 68000 processor which takes care of everything except sound. That is done by a Z80 controlling a YM2610. Sound commands are written to the Z80 by the 68000.

CHANGES:

- Wec le Mans 24 (Acho A. Tang): Generalized blitter to support Wec Le Mans, emulated custom alpha blending chip used for protection, fixed game color and sound volume, added shadows and sprite-to-sprite priority, added curbs effect, modified zoom equation to close tile gaps, fixed a few tile glitches, converted driver to use RGB direct, cloud transition(needs verification from board owners), fixed sound banking and source clean-up.

During boot up the BIOS decrypts parts of itself into ram using a device connected to the PSX controller port. As this is not emulated yet you only get the boot up colours.

- Capcom ZN1/ZN2: The QSound hardware is different to cps2 as it uses an i/o port and nmi's instead of shared memory. The driver uses 8bit i/o addresses but the real ZN1 hardware may use 16bit i/o addresses as the code always accesses port 0xf100. The ZN2 code however seems to vary the top eight bits of the address, this may or may not be important but it is currently ignored.

- The Gallop Racer dump came from a Capcom ZN1 QSound board but there were no QSound program/sample roms & the game doesn't appear to use it. Tecmo went on to produce games on their own boards.


WIP:

- 0.83: smf fixes Heavens Gate and Super Football Champ and added Taito FX-1 watchdog (address is unconfirmed, but hopefully soon) and horizontal start/end.

- 19th May 2004: R. Belmont - ZN1 / ZN2 status: Progress has been made on breaking the ZN1/ZN2 protection chip, which seems to contain an 8 byte table. With this in mind, we need access to all the ZN1/ZN2 game PCBs to dump those protection chips on the main boards and game boards. The main board protection is per BIOS. Meaning there is only one used for each BIOS type. The game board protection chip is different for each game.

-  8th April 2004: smf sent in another update to the 24-bit MDEC support in the PSX driver.

-  5th April 2004: smf added 24-bit display support to the PSX driver, as required by Judge Dredd.

- 0.81u3: smf and R. Belmont made more various ZN updates. Several games are improved (Brave Blade, Judge Dredd etc.) but still need work. Change the number of buttons to 6 again in all games.

-  3rd April 2004: Olivier Galibert fixed the ZN protection chip emulation so more games boot now.

- 0.81: smf and R. Belmont made various ZN related updates. Several games now display more, for example primrag2 plays the intro movie. Add 'Freeze' dipswitch and change the number of buttons to 3.

-  9th March 2004: Guru - Now that many of the ZN security chips are dumped, we're beginning to see some action on screen, but only in Gallop Racer so far. The majority of the remaining ZN1 games have further protection that prevents them from working right now. But the ones that run on the Capcom ZN1 hardware will work now. Unfortunately we only have the protection chip for Gallop Racer, so only this one can work at the moment. We really need the remaining ZN security chips to get further with the emulation of the other games.

-  6th March 2004: Guru - Updated the ZNx Dump Status page, plus added some pics to show how it's done. If you have those remaining undumped ZN games and want to loan them for dumping, or want to donate towards the other completely undumped ZN1 games, contact me.

- 0.80: Added 'Service Mode' dipswitch.

-  3rd March 2004: smf did a bit of re-organizing and cleanup on the ZN driver.

-  1st March 2004: Brian A. Troha fixed ROM loading for a few games in the ZN driver. smf also sent some updates to the ZN driver.

- 0.79u3: Added PSX_SPU sound to all games.

- 0.79u1: Correct PSX_CPU CPU1 clock speed to 16934400 Hz and graphics resolution to 640x480.

TODO:

- Verify Z80 and AY8910 clock speeds.


Possible Bugs:

- 'The Bounty' has only game music. 'The Percussor' (same driver) has also a shoot sound (press P1 Button 2 - ALT KEY). Are some sound in 'The Bounty' missing? zodiackc37b15gre MASH


WIP:

- 15th August 2003: Brad Oliver fixed the Zodiack video hardware emulation so that it is multi-session safe.

- 26th November 1999: Zsolt Vasvari added The Percussor to the Zodiack driver.

- 18th May 1999: Zsolt Vasvari added Dogfight and Moguchan to the Zodiack driver.

- 17th May 1999: Zsolt Vasvari sent in a driver for Zodiack.

- 28th February 2001: Nicola Salmoria added Bounty to the Orca driver.
